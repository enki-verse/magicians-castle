# The Unconscious

## The unconscious

there needs perhaps to be a separate section where we talk about those aspects which are beyond comprehension. and which nonetheless have entered into our castle in some way. they are unspeakable. and yet they do exist. they sit between the tonal and the ground of being. they are intuition and a vast wisdom that we cannot comprehend, they are without many of the limiting valves that sit closer to our conception of self, time and world. and thus they may hold extreme power and truth, as they are close to the sea of pure beautiful chaos. to the face of god.

These unconscious forces enter only the very outskirts of the castle, they have not yet collapsed to a particle state.

In Nietzsche, there is no universal truth. The truthfulness of truth is at once a lie. Untruth, Nietzsche tells us, is "a condition of life". Everything for Nietzsche, including the reception of his work, is a mask. "Every philosophy", he writes, "also conceals a philosophy; every opinion is also a hiding-place, every word also a mask". *(does this quote fit here?)*

Affirmed divergence props itself up and forms feedback loops. Much like the ancient holophrase of Barfield, where multiple meanings occupied single words, as in the Greek word pneuma meaning breath, spirit, or wind; or Lie meaning deception or place: signing is hallucinatory, every word is a mask.

The map is not the territory. All structures are fundamentally maya. However we do gain something to re-gift back to the ground of being by extruding.

There is no fundamental right way to structure the interior of the castle as there is an inevitable collapse of the wave function to make it function.

masks, are another name for an avatar. and when we reach out to the unconscious we are confronted with powerful forces and beings which have not collapsed into graspable particle yet.

> "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern"

The "narrow cavern" is akin to Castaneda's "tonal", and it is surely the "nagual" that is the hallucination, or perhaps more specifically behind the hallucination. *(text could benefit from a more in depth introduction to nagual and tonal)*

The astral/nagual produces a hallucination (i.e. the tonal) in order for you to cognise it: 

> "Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this particular planet."

I would go further and say that the further we get to the source of the nagual, the more the tonal is activated and energized to try and cognize what is coming to you. As we go about business as usual in a materialist/capitalist society we are far from the nagual and so your tonal is also deactivated and mostly dead in its symbology and linkage. As we move closer to becoming sorcerer, to the nagual the tonal is activated and energized. This simultaneous contrast forms a feedback loop that props itself up, and intensifies itself in every effort to de-stabilize it, through removing another layer of the tonal/the valve/ the cavern, as we head toward the Nagual/ astral/ Infinity/ transcendental object at the end of time/ final participation

## Thought Forms

*(astral communication)*

*(how is this different from the previous section on the unconscious? in the section below i talk about it as the nagual again but i think thought forms are actually in the tonal but close to the nagual.)*

There is an image world that is structured very differently than our currently accepted logical language. It is the world of thought forms. It can be found at night before bed, as one closes one's eyes, through the use of hallucinogens or in dreams.

It presents us with a non logic: akin to Castaneda's accounts in his books on the teachings of Don Juan, there are two forms of reality, the tonal and the nagual. "In order to talk about it we must borrow from the island of the tonal, therefore it is more convenient not to explain it but to simply recount its effects." "a voice that comes from the depths, the voice of the nagual." "You may die if you come into direct physical contact with the nagual". This is the idea of seeing the face of god which you may die from or at least go mad.

There is an occult tradition of seeing thought forms often emanating from auras, Annie Besant in her book with C.W. Leadbeater *Thought Forms* (1901) depicts thought forms as real things that can be created intentionally or unintentionally by an entity, it could be a nature spirit, a dead person or a living person, and then could be observed by another with the correct "sight". She divided thought forms into three types: the shape of the person that creates them, all other shapes recognised as a visualisation of a physical world object, and finally abstract forms representing astral or mental planes. I find her classification strange; I would simply classify thought forms as the third category, abstract forms that may represent astral and mental planes. I would leave visualisations of realistic objects out of it in their own category.

In the book there are some illustrations of vibration plates and pendulums that produce geometric patterns, the similarity to the images produced by thought forms is noted. It is hypothesized that just as two opposing (or of differing ratios) forces produce physical patterns of resonance, so too the thought forms may be a production of multiple forces intermingling and producing resonances. This is an interesting suggestion, bearing fruits of analogy: perhaps the astral is always in dissonance, always in a state of becoming, "all becomings are written like sorcerers' drawings on [the] plane of consistency". The plane of consistency is "the ultimate Door providing a way out" for becomings. Aldous Huxley's *Doors of Perception* open an astral imaging, an opening onto infinite resonances all the way into "the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infinity"

Returning to Besant's book *Thought Forms*, we find two illustrations produced by pendulums that spark our interest:

[Images would go here]

These images are so similar to psychedelic imagery, there was no widespread western mushroom or mescaline use in the 19th century, only opium which produced dream states and hallucinations of a sort, although not visually intricate patterns, not intensely conscious visualisations. I think these forms are consistent with some kind of fundamental perception in human experience; whether or not it is representative of an astral plane. However wouldn't it be more interesting to use these visualisations as another interpretive layer? *(needs elaboration, seems important)*

## The Logos

*(higher self/ego communication)*

*("voices" and "thought forms" are more of a gradation than delineated.)*

*(in this section we introduce the idea of genius. In Roman tradition, genius was a guiding spirit that connected an individual to the divine. It wasn't the person's mind or talent but rather a force that worked through them. it is the same as the logos and the ego or magician)*

There is a consciousness that accompanies thought forms, this can also come in the form of voices. McKenna calls it Logos: the voice in the head that people had in the Greco roman world – what people were striving for, that told you how to live and gave you answers. For example Socrates had a daemon that was his crap detector, an invisible agency speaking from hyperspace. This Logos/Gaian mind apparently fell silent around the time of Christ, perhaps as a result of the ego entering fully into the human. Anyhow it still seems to pop up now and then: McKenna recounts the dream Descartes had whilst he was a young soldier that changed his life and history in a new direction. An angel came to him and told him that conquest is to be achieved through number and measurement. Modern scientific materialism was founded by an angel.

Mckenna's own visions often involve "self-transforming machine elves", "There are forces friendly to our struggle to birth ourselves as an intelligent species". "Right here and now, one quanta away, there is raging a universe of active intelligence that is transhuman, hyperdimensional, and extremely alien." These are beings from another dimension of which Steiner perhaps has had similar visions?: "The gnomes laugh us to scorn on account of the groping, struggling understanding with which we manage to grasp one thing or another…gnomes become ironical to the point of ill manners if one speaks to them of logic ... Thus the gnomes, inside the earth, are actually the bearers of the ideas of the universe"

As for me, as I have stated earlier my voices have never spoken aloud but have been knowings that have come to me, these are perhaps just my imagination, or perhaps the imagination itself gives us something more solid than we give it credit for. *(change to us, we, our?)*
