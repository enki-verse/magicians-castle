# Chaos vs Order

## Growing and Dying: The Creative vs The Tyrant

Castles are structured to contain the chaos that they encounter.

Castles wish to continue growing and building themselves. We can further define that the order of the castle may be **dynamic quality orientated** or **quantity orientated**. Quantity orientated can become tyrannical in its self-replication, whereas quality orientated is creative and more open to restructuring. Quantity increases the reach of possible actions and quality increases the set of known actions.

## The Four Configurations

|  | **Quantity** (increases Possibilities) |  |
|---|---|---|
|  | **Dis-ordered** | **Ordered** |
| **Quality** (Increases known actions) | **Un-chaotic** | Zombie | Tyrant |
|  | **Chaotic** | Punk | Creative |

Punk and zombie configurations present no challenge to the tyrant and the creative. It is the **Tyrant** and the **Creative** structure that is in an endless battle. They are the two great forces that reach for freedom: Creative order and pathological order.

This is a dynamic within each of us but it also plays out in ideology and social dynamics. There is a pendulum that swings between the two over history.

## Historical Examples

Alexander the Great conquered half the world as did the Persian Empire before him, the bloody and power hungry nations unified many countries. Eventually leading to great growth in the sharing of knowledge as seen in the library of Alexandria. **Tyrannical order gave way to a creative one.**

Existence appears to have a self-righting mechanism. However, many front-on attempts to confront tyranny (or pathological order) in the pursuit of freedom only result in another tyranny. Pushing this to the extreme we can consider the motives of the Nazis in the Second World War. Out of an impulse to remove the tyranny of debt, Nazi Germany arose (a simplification I know). Anti-Semitism is misplaced anti-banking and debt trading, the real problem is the way banks control ever more of the people's assets. Out of an impulse for freedom for Germany came pathological acts of control and ordering.

## Science Fiction as Metaphor

### The Invisibles by Grant Morrison

**The Invisibles** is a comic book created by Grant Morrison. There are many planes of reality simultaneously existing together. Magic, aliens, time travel, soul travel, gods, angels, psychics, robots etc etc. The landscape that the characters swim in is constantly changing. All that stays the same is the two forces that are battling each other, one of pathological order and one of freedom. Both sides use any technology or magic they can. The invisibles are an eclectic mix of individuals with various abilities operating mostly with their own volition and ideas. The invisibles are battling against interdimensional alien gods that have a hierarchical system of control and have already enslaved most of the human race without their knowledge. Grant Morrison created three volumes of this comic as a super sigil to help wake up and save humanity from the forces of domination.

### The Incal by Jodorowsky and Moebius

For some reason there is an intersection between major contemporary wizards and comic book creators. Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, and Jodorowsky all openly profess their love and use of magic. After the tragedy of Dune, Jodorowsky began to create comic books—he could move even faster and further through ideas, as the artist would only be limited by their pen rather than costly movie production. With Jean Giraud (Moebius) drawing, he created **The Incal**, an epic multiplanetary - multi-dimensional space opera. Themes include spiritual transformation, eternal return, mystical symbolism and Tarot. And the battle continues between "uniformity and diversity" or pathological order and freedom.

## The Eternal Struggle

These examples of science fiction are indicative of an eternal struggle between pathological and creative freedom. The protagonists and to a greater extent the authors live in a way that is "excellent", increasing freedom and the expansion of consciousness through imagination. The more links they or we can integrate, the further one can expand, in a sea of consciousness that is without bounds, breaking out of any reality tunnel or matrix that is restricting one.

If existence is pure consciousness, with stories embedded in myths embedded in stories, then life becomes a kind of game. The universe and imagination spontaneously erupt infinitely, let's embrace this life with joy: **"party on dudes"**

## Living Castles vs Dead Cathedrals

A good spell will create a strong avatar. It will be highly living and highly restructuring. Its beauty will allow it entrance to a castle and allow it to integrate. An even better spell is a collection of avatars, like a circus troupe.

A **living castle** is childlike, playful and creative. It delineates a structure that contains many lenses, like the kabbalistic tree of life that integrates any concepts it comes in contact with. 

When the **Monkey** wears the crown, the castle withers. It becomes stagnant. It does however still produce avatars unconsciously and these may infect other surrounding castles. The monkey avatar self has no imagination. They do not have the ability to integrate the chaos which constantly surrounds us. And as we know if we do not integrate it, both chaos and order may become pathological.

**Castles are infectious. A living castle may enliven another.**

When a castle becomes stagnant and pathological, it may become a **Cathedral**—a self-replicating structure designed to perpetuate its own existence at the expense of individual freedom. These are the cathedrals of cults, religions, materialism, and consumerism, wokism and conservatism—structures designed to perpetuate their own existence.

## The Path Forward

The opportunity before us is to create reality tunnels that minimize self-propagation and optimize for personal freedom. Could we make a "cult" about breaking out of cults? An anarchist matrix?

We must find meaningful movements and embodiments to support the worlds we wish to create. Like the great cathedrals, paradigms, and rituals of the past, we must cast our visions into being.

We would reclaim the power of mythology, visionary art and ritual movement and all forms of integrated spiritual material, and use them to give ourselves the power of the gods, to be creators of our own reality.

## Navigation Through Chaos and Order

*(This section on how we structure our castle for freedom continues in [[06-Navigation b-Active Imagination methods]])*

Castles of individual freedom = **structuring**
Navigating the ground of being = **navigation**

We have already touched on the primacy of the imagination. If imagination is the basis of reality then anything we can think is real. So then how do we navigate it? Given the apparent lack of transcendental signifieds, can we say that true and false exist?

Some suggestions from the past have been Beauty, humanity, wisdom producing.

### The Deepest Foundation

The Deepest foundation sits outside of time and space. It is a gravitational anchor of love and beauty for the castle. It is the embodiment of Christ; it is the overman as the meaning of the earth. It will be our map, a picture of the path of initiation, and the philosophers' stone. Once we become aware of the forces that give our castle structure we can amplify them and increase the dynamic growth of our castle.

We begin as a child. And the child calls us to join them in the future. **To know is to love.** The expansion of consciousness is an act of love. A baby/child is full of this love, they send out all their impulses and see what they receive.
