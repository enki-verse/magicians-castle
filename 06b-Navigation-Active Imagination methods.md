# Active Imagination Methods

## The Bridge Between Mind at Large and Individual Self

In the end, the best form of navigation is to accept that anything can be real to the extent that it develops its unified complexity, and we can develop any imaginary idea or avatar through visionary imagination.

**Active Imagination** is a technique we may use as the wizard to summon avatars into the castle, to make them living, and to integrate them into the structure of the castle. Jung coined the term Active imagination, which defines itself in opposition to passive imagination, such as dreams or simply daytime reveries of various sorts. Being active means participating in the imaginative realm. Thus forming a link between the conscious and the subconscious mind.

## Understanding the Unconscious

It is worth noting that the term **unconscious** is misleading. Jung believed that our dream life always exists in every moment, however the part of us that is self-reflective is not always in communication with this part of ourselves. 

Bernardo Kastrup points to multiple personality disorders, and the evidence that alters are conscious even when they are not in the driver seat. Donald Hoffman also uses the knowledge provided by split brain experiments carried out in epileptic patients: in an effort to restrict the seizure spreading from one side of the brain to the other the corpus callosum is cut. This helped the patients with their seizure, however it also demonstrated through further experiments that both halves of the brain were conscious, they could hold differing religious views and could function independently.

I bring up these examples as evidence that there are most likely parts of our mind that aren't in the spotlight of our neocortex or our rational reflective mind. But are nonetheless conscious. Thus when I unavoidably use the term unconscious, I am referring to those parts of our larger self that have not been in the spotlight of the small self, our construction of ourselves as a separate being.

## Expanding Beyond the Small Self

Our fairly narrow and perhaps fragile self-image that locates ourselves as an individual, and allows us the necessities of clock time and bodily boundary only occupies a tiny epicenter of our possible larger self. If we can move outwards we can meet the alters that live with us in the metabolism of our body. 

**Physically** these include:
- Our stomach mind
- Our heart
- Our mammalian brain
- Our reptilian brain

**Psychologically** this includes our unconscious. 

As we reach further out we encounter other humans that we can only communicate over a limited bandwidth. In the interior realm we can also reach further into imaginative worlds and encounters with other beings and gods. Various parts of our higher self reside in a scale of connection with the infinite consciousness of the universe.

## The First Step: Accepting Imagination as Real

The first step of active imagination is to **accept imagination as real**, at least as much as the exterior world is real. If we can do this, we allow ourselves the impetus to be active participants in the world of the imagination, which beckons to us when given the status of ontological primitive. With the will to participate we then need to allow the obfuscated mind to reveal itself.

Our everyday existence is mostly made up of a chattering monkey mind, which we can visualize as ourselves in a large castle shining a bright torch on a manikin that stands before us. This manikin is the **false self**. It is a zombie avatar that we sleepily accept as our real self. We are shining this torch so brightly at the zombie avatar that our eyes are blinded to the large hall around us. The tapestries, paintings, bookshelves and curiosities of our unconscious are all shrouded in darkness, our eyes cannot adjust to them.

---

## Method 1: Move Away From Your Small Self

We need to destroy the zombie avatar. We may need to **occupy**, **annihilate**, or **subdue** our small self, through repetitive activity, pushing ourselves to our limits and meditation respectively.

### Occupy
Occupy through tasks such as:
- Dancing
- Writing
- Painting

> "An indirect approach, which often reveals the unconscious particularly well, is to write stories, also about other people. Such stories reveal to the narrator the soul parts of which he is completely unconscious." — Jung

### Annihilate
Annihilate through:
- Breath work
- Various forms of visionquest
- Psychedelics

These take us out of our body and our small self.

### Subdue
Subdue through meditation.

### Historical Examples
- Coleridge inhibited his monkey mind with opium
- Julia Cameron uses morning pages to cognize and clear her chitter chatter
- Many artists find music helps them
- Others enter a hypnagogic state pre or post sleep

Beyond these techniques we may simply be able to shine our torch away from the Zombie avatar and towards the wall. The simple turning of the torch becomes increasingly easier after we have destroyed the false self a few times. And yes, I'll have you know that the zombie avatar often reforms instantaneously so it's an ongoing distraction for all of us that function in the physical world.

## Method 2: Look Into Infinite Being

This is the other side of the coin from the last step, so it happens simultaneously. 

### Historical Techniques

**Salvador Dali** had several methods of entering a hypnagogic state in which he could look into infinite being:
- He recommends planting olive trees around the house so that the leaves may create a soup of flickering, which may seduce your eyes in vision into reverie
- He also recommended spending hours with a blank white canvas at dusk

**Leonardo Da Vinci** similarly recommended looking into splashes of mud in order that visions might be generated: 

> "By indistinct things the mind is stimulated to new inventions"

**Day and night dreams** are also fundamental hypnagogic states which Tolkien and Jung are inspired by (see the dark water section).

### Practical Approaches

Fundamentally we need to open our awareness to the subconscious. **"Learn to see or hear the dream while awake"**

One approach is **image streaming**, or one can take on more solid forms in order to limit the shape shifting. Or also to allow the subconscious to enter through the hands etc.

#### Methods for Visioning

**Open-ended modes:**
- White noise
- The Ganzfeld effect
- Wim Hof breathing
- Simply watching your third eye and inner stream

**Directed modes:**
If trying to be more specific, direct your imagination with a particular scene in mind.

## Method 3: Curiosity - Begin the Dialogue

The next step is to begin a dialogue. Would you like to speak first? You can, however a dialogue can start from any side.

### The Old Man of the Sea

Let's say you happen to shine your light on the old man of the sea, who is probably loitering somewhere in the room. The problem is as soon as you shine your light on him he will shift:

> "into a bearded lion and then into a snake and after that a panther and a giant boar. He changed into running water too and a great tree with many leaves."

However you must always remember that he is the old man of the sea and keep your light on him. The unconscious or infinite being has made the first move in the dialogue by revealing to you the old man. 

If you are to keep the dialogue going which is the purpose of active imagination (and the purpose of life) you need to **ask a question**. In this case we could simply ask "what do you have to tell me old man?". And we must remember this question through the morphing image stream. Otherwise we may lose our reflective self, and the dialogue will be a monologue again.

### The Parsifal Principle

Like Parsifal we must ask the question in order to save the land:

> "Although, to a certain extent, he looks on from outside, impartially, he is also an acting and suffering figure in the drama of the psyche. This recognition is absolutely necessary and marks an important advance. So long as he simply looks at the pictures he is like the foolish Parsifal, who forgot to ask the vital question because he was not aware of his own participation in the action. But if you recognize your own involvement you yourself must enter into the process with your personal reactions, just as if you were one of the fantasy figures, or rather, as if the drama being enacted before your eyes were real." — Jung

**The reality of the imagination is complete in itself.** We should not interpret it with any theory. Take the reality of the Imaginal realm as it is, and question the various forces so that they may respond.

---

## Method 4: Embody (Navigation and Structuring)

Another method of holding on to forms produced by infinite consciousness is through creating things.

> "the picture must be protected from sinking back into the unconscious, be it by drawing, painting or writing down what one has heard or seen."

Part of our trouble stems from the fact that we are encountering another dimension:

> "We are only aware of three dimensions, while the figures of the unconscious approach us from an unknown fourth dimension."

This is perhaps the reason why:
a) We find it hard to see the unconscious realm, i.e. it often appears as a stream of imagery when we are trying to look at one thing
b) The logic must be interpreted according to its own rules. It exists in another dimension, where time and space are irrelevant

Something about trying to record our vision will often help to discover it further. In a Heideggerian world disclosure that brings the vision or avatar into a physical space, and starts the process of **embodiment**.

---

## Method 5: Love (Navigation)

A danger of active imagination is falling into the abyss.

> "The method is not entirely without danger, because it may carry the patient too far away from reality" 

> "Danger arises whenever the narrowly delimited, but intensely clear, individual consciousness meets the immense expansion of the collective unconscious, because the latter has a definitely disintegrating effect on consciousness."

We may lose touch with the outside world or become trapped in a malevolent loop. There is a single fix for both these problems: **Love**.

### Love as Protection

**Love for beings in the finite world keeps us in touch**, and **love for beings in the infinite world transforms malevolence**, revealing and connecting us with truth, and eventually consuming the once malevolent being into the higher self.

In terms of connection to finite beings Jung pointed out that the difference between his journey writing the Red Book and Nietzsche writing Zarathustra was that he had children and a family whereas Nietzsche was blown about like a leaf in the wind because he had no roots.

### Love as Transformation

In addition to staying grounded with our physical loved ones we also need to take love with us on our journey into the depths of the psychic realm. 

**Love every being you find.** Love all beings that you experience. Especially the ones you are repelled or scared by. Love conquers all, and allows shadows to integrate rather than fracture and become 'radicalized'. Everything has something to reveal to you and to add to your castle.

### The Intelligence of the Heart

Schwaller de Lubicz suggests we can navigate the Imaginal realm by using the intelligence of the heart:

> "Awakening is the awakening of the intelligence-of-the-heart... If we give it preponderance over cerebral intelligence, over the mental, it will tell us everything, for it is the intelligence of the universe."

Lubicz identifies that existence is far wider than we comprehend with our rationality. And that our feeling realm can reach wider and encompass more.

Gurdjieff and Ouspensky call us to try and move beyond our primary imagination or our reality tunnel of Maya that we are sleep walking in. We may wake up by deliberate exercises in self-remembering that produce strange intensities of feeling.

---

## Method 6: Beauty (Structuring or Navigating Structure)

### Beauty = Unified Chaos

McKenna makes the point that we can no longer point to what is true anymore, nor what is good/moral. But he believes we still know what is beautiful, and that we can use **beauty as a gauge to evaluate truth**. So if an idea is beautiful it is probably true.

Beauty in this sense is probably closer to a Kantian notion, an aesthetic experience capable of generating criticality, rather than beauty as prettiness. Beauty will be a forever-unachievable goal that our castle will constantly gravitate towards.

### Finding Beauty Everywhere

Beauty is everywhere and in everything. There is a bible story where Christ looks at the dead dog that people are deriding, and turns their attention to the beautiful white teeth the dog has.

Rudolf Steiner in his book *How to know higher worlds*, says that the path to initiation and gnosis, is to find the good in everyone we meet or situation we find ourselves in, that way we'll always be learning, and taking on images that we find the beauty in through a diverse range of realms.

### Wabi-Sabi

This extended form of beauty is encapsulated by the term **Wabi-sabi** from Japan, meaning the beauty of imperfection, which although paradoxical is a simple reminder that although something is imperfect on one level it can be perfect on another. Wabi-sabi reminds us of a higher order.

### Living Ideas

A beautiful idea is one that is **living**; it has the ability to speak to the soul and to enliven the castle. We will see that they are beautiful and flowering. **We shall know them by their fruits!** 

Corbin suggests as much, true imagination will produce knowledge and wisdom:

> "Corbin was aware of the question… of how inner voyagers, travellers in the imaginal, can navigate among the rocks and the shallows of fantasy and on to the wider waters of true imagination"

### The Path to Wisdom

Henry Corbin takes a more pragmatic route. We need to 'protect imagination… from reckless wastage' only continuing to pursue things that "lead to inner intelligence". 

True imagination is knowledge and wisdom producing; it is Mind revealing itself. It is part of "a plurality of universes arranged in ascending order". In this sense we can navigate any imagination as long as we have developed a kabbalist castle capable of integration.

### Wholeness

Erich Kahler would call this **Wholeness**. Imagination is navigated by re-integrating and making whole and thus forming wisdom:

> "Whenever new spheres, new depths of existence are disclosed by a thrust into the unknown, these experiences will have to be integrated into a further complete whole [a] broader, more comprehensive, perfection of form… again and again the wholeness of existence must be re-established. a new wider and more complex wholeness must be apprehended"

---

## Method 7: Detachment (Navigation)

After radical love we must add **radical detachment**. We must regard all of experience both inward and outward as a myth. This gives us a profound grasp on the true nature of reality.

### Can You Hold the Void?

**"Emptiness"** is the magic word that names the essence of the universe. Again, as in many magical traditions, to name a thing by its true name—the secret essence of the thing—is to own it, and to understand how public reality evolves from Emptiness into awareness or perception is to be free of its bonds of ordinary causality, to be free, in Buddhist terms, of "being." 

If we understand that every reality is a myth, then we have greater power.

## Case Study: Julie Heffernan

Julie Heffernan is a contemporary practitioner of active imagination. She doesn't directly use the phrase active imagination, but she does talk of her discovery and subsequent use of image streaming. Her image streaming forms one side of an active imagination dialogue that makes up her practice. Each vision (old man of the sea) is captured and put down on the canvas then she listens to her dream self to tell her what the next step is. Sometimes she will begin with a mechanized reproduction of an image idea, however the construction of this image becomes a "frottage" onto which she may search out dreams.

### Her Discovery

She describes first discovering the technique in a hypnagogic state following a long day of painting:

> "I was painting for twelve hours a day….exhausted, I shut my eyes and went into a relaxed state. Suddenly I started to see pictures pouring into my head."

She had discovered another world that benefited her practice immensely. Eventually, she moved on from her initial unplanned technique of exhaustion, and now simply begins the painting with a first layer of paint, which she now has the ability to feed to her subconscious and allow for a response.

### Her Method

Her method is to continue the dialogue between the created image and her inner image stream.

> "It's really fun to paint this way. A lot of people start with a drawing but I think it kills the process. Each character walks on into my conscious mind"

Giving the character the stream into her agency allows them to come to life, and thus she is able to begin a dialogue with them.

### The Success of Her Approach

Heffernan is very aware that she wants to also construct the painting spatially. She has a discipline that is able to hold her visions. She is a successful surrealist, and that is not a title that can be applied often, since its inception those designated as surrealists have mostly failed either not really finding the limitless nature of the imagination or more likely not finding a discipline that will balance their dreams and allow a dialogue.

A main problem with surrealism is the falling into stereotypes. This comes about by imposing theories such as Freudian analysis on the vision and directing it according to that logic. **The reality of the imagination is complete in itself.** We should not interpret it with any theory. Take the reality of the Imaginal realm as it is, and question the various forces so that they may respond.

### Max Ernst's Frottage

Max Ernst was semi successful in escaping this trap through his use of frottage, which often allowed for a break away from Freudian setups. I believe he genuinely allowed the other dimension to enter in this way.

## The Reality of Dreams

Dreams exist in a different realm of logic. If we can enter into this logic, and accept it as real, further truths may unfold to us. **To use active imagination we have to accept unconscious dreams as just as real as the outer world.**

Active imagination facilitates the union of opposites. This brings about peace on earth. Our environment will respond in kind to our vibration. Once we unify our opposites, the conscious and the unconscious, the mycelium and the mushroom, our reality will become heaven on earth.

Successfully surrealism applies active imagination to the imaginal realm.
