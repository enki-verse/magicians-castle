# Introduction

## Why this book?

This book is an instruction manual for freedom. Presenting a view of what is the landscape of reality and what can be achieved within it. The universal framework of consciousness and our unique "theatre of awareness". 

The universal framework is the castle, upon which have built our unique perspective, often shaped by cultural, biological, and metaphysical forces beyond our awareness.

It confronts the forces that shape the theatre's construction and offers tools for individuals to restructure their own theatre, optimizing them for personal freedom rather than conforming to the worldviews of the many cultural "cults" in which we grow up

Mind and matter are not separate; they are one. We experience ourselves in physical bodies, but these bodies and the world around us are expressions of mind. Through movement, storytelling, ritual, and all forms of embodied experience, Mind manifests itself. Embodiment is the actualization of mind.

Across cultures, various costumes and "masks" designate power and significance. These rituals embody the ideas most important to their cultures. For many, this is fulfilling. People find richness in the intricate layers of their inherited cultural embodiments: the Body of Christ, the totem animal, or other sacred symbols. Others, however, find themselves in post-religious, consumerist cultures with their own rituals—sports, music festivals, branding—which often lack the same depth of useful meaning.

For myself and many others, we find ourselves without a clear cultural position, either through migration or exploration of new paradigms. This absence is both a loss and a gift. Without a secure foundation, we face uncertainty. Yet it also opens a vast space for creative freedom—the possibility of building something better. This freedom allows us to take what works for us and develop it into something personal and transformative. We call this process mythology unbound.

Many paradigms of the past have been self-sustaining to the point of limiting the freedom of their disciples. They propagate themselves at the expense of individual potential. These are the cathedrals of cults, religions, materialism, and consumerism, wokism and conservatism —structures designed to perpetuate their own existence.

The opportunity before us is to create reality tunnels that minimize self-propagation and optimize for personal freedom. Could we make a "cult" about breaking out of cults? An anarchist matrix?

This is why we must find meaningful movements and embodiments to support the worlds we wish to create. Like the great cathedrals, paradigms, and rituals of the past, we must cast our visions into being.

We would reclaim the power of mythology, visionary art and ritual movement and all forms of integrated spiritual material. and use them to give ourselves the power of the gods. to be creators of our own reality.

you may read this and be questioning our sanity but we assure you we have clear eyes. we know we cannot fly..... but a time is coming soon when we can.

## Idealism

Before we go further we should explain that idealism is taken by us as given. This book is built upon the foundation of Idealism—the understanding that consciousness is fundamental, and what we perceive as the material world is its extrinsic appearance. Materialism assumes that consciousness arises from physical structures, yet it cannot explain how subjective experience emerges from unconscious matter. Neuroscience has shown that deep meditative states, near-death experiences, and psychedelics often result in heightened awareness despite suppressed brain activity, suggesting that consciousness is not merely a product of neural computation.

If mind is primary, then the world we experience is not an objective, mind-independent reality, but rather a shared projection of consciousness. Bernardo Kastrup proposes that what we call the "physical world" is simply the outer appearance of mental activity, much like how neurons in a brain are the physical correlate of thoughts and emotions. Just as an individual's conscious experiences are expressed through the body, the universe itself may be the extrinsic appearance of a vast transpersonal consciousness—Mind at Large. In this view, our sense of separateness is an illusion created by dissociation, much like how individuals with dissociative identity disorder experience multiple selves within a single mind.

This perspective aligns with both quantum mechanics and ancient spiritual traditions. The observer effect in quantum physics suggests that reality does not take a definite form until it is observed, undermining the idea of a world that exists independently of consciousness. If perception shapes reality at the most fundamental level, then mind is not something trapped inside the body—it is the very fabric of existence itself.

This book takes Idealism to its natural conclusion: if all is mind, then meaning is not an arbitrary human construct but an intrinsic feature of reality. Unlike religions that seek to transcend suffering by escaping the body, I argue that the purpose of existence is embodiment—the extrusion of mind into understanding. We are not here to dissolve back into an undifferentiated void, but to create, experience, and refine structures that give shape to being.

Rather than viewing existence as something to be endured or escaped, we reclaim it as an act of creative participation. To live is to build, to extrude, to embody. Mind at Large, in its vast and formless state, lacks perspective; it is through our differentiation, our pain, our enjoyment and our unique experiences that the infinite gains self-awareness. We are not here to escape the world—we are here to become it.

## Visualising Reality

The majority of this book will present a physical representation of reality that is understandable to extruded consciousness, in order that we may navigate and evolve. We present reality as a castle of ontology. Which can be divided into three parts. These metaphors are the ground, the castle, and the magician. Each works in a process with the others.

**The Ground:** An image of the mind at large—the infinite consciousness we experience and translate as the universe.

**The Castle:** an extrusion out of the ground of being. An alter that has become dissociated from mind at large, and therefore has an ego. A castle is a dynamic ontological map representing the manifold structures and experiences of being. The castle holds our experience, which is the theatre`of awareness: a vast collection of avatars that are in various states of connection and interaction with one another.

**The Magician:** Our higher self, the creative consciousness that inhabits the castle. The magician receives and creates avatars, which both construct the castle and journey outward to engage with other castles. The magician is the first envelope of the light of consciousness, which illuminates all other avatars including the monkey. The monkey is a tool of the magician which the light of consciousness often mistakes for the magician as it produces internal monologue. The magician evolves the castle whilst the monkey stagnates it.

These metaphors will serve as the foundation for a deeper exploration into the process of navigating infinite being and the coming apocalypse culminating in "real-world outcomes."

This journey invites you to question, imagine, and participate actively in the creation of reality.
