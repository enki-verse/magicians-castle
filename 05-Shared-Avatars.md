# Shared Avatars & Chaos vs Order

## Shared Avatars

*(also called cults, or cathedrals)*

There is a social dynamic that arises between castles as they share their avatars.

Certain avatars may get stronger as they are reinforced and become dominant in reshaping a group's castles. An Ideology is a particular group of avatars that is self-strengthening, this creates a symbiotic relationship that usually allows for the castle construction to be mostly automated. Some examples are Catholicism, Communism, Consumerism, all cults, and all movements. Some of these "cults" are profoundly positively transformative. They usually help a person to shed one reality tunnel and reinstate a new one. Their success lies in "brainwashing" like a baptism, in which you are able to shed "what no longer serves you". Within a social structure or a cult we are rewarded or punished for our "good" or "bad" behaviour. On its own this may all not be a bad thing if we wish the new reality tunnel to become ours. Many people already set themselves rewards or punishments to help develop the behaviours and thinking that they would like.

Leaders of movements generally are trying to help people become better. Some allow for more movement of development and some are more controlling. For an organisation to grow and thus help more people there needs to be a strong cathedral. This allows for easier transformations, people can easily drop into a new reality tunnel.

These movements can be seriously transformational. Radically re-shifting the castles of multiple people out of the (usually consumer) paradigm they are stuck in. Social cathedrals allow for power from the castles to flow into the cathedral. The teacher that is providing the transformitory cathedral receives power as the creator of the cathedral. And often the power can go to their heads, especially as it is the exercising of power that continues to build the cathedral.

Cathedrals much like castles need to have clear hierarchies if they are going to integrate the chaos around them. Many movements don't have this hierarchy they quickly disperse. On the other hand the world's dominant reality tunnel, consumerism may have become vaster than anyone can control but it is also literally eating itself and will eventually perish.

If you wish to be saved from slavery you will have to annihilate what "must be annihilated". To become the Child again, the creative yes being. William Blake shows us the way:

> "Obey thou the Words of the Inspired Man
> All that can be annihilated must be annihilated
> 
> That the Children of Jerusalem may be saved from slavery
> There is a Negation, & there is a Contrary
> The Negation must be destroyed to redeem the Contraries
> The Negation is the Spectre; the Reasoning Power in Man
> This is a false Body: an Incrustation over my Immortal
> Spirit; a Selfhood, which must be put off & annihilated alway
> To cleanse the Face of my Spirit by Self-examination.
> 
> To bathe in the Waters of Life; to wash off the Not Human
> I come in Self-annihilation & the grandeur of Inspiration
> To cast off Rational Demonstration by Faith in the Saviour
> To cast off the rotten rags of Memory by Inspiration
> To cast off Bacon, Locke & Newton from Albions covering
> To take off his filthy garments, & clothe him with Imagination
> To cast aside from Poetry, all that is not Inspiration"

## Chaos vs order

*(Growing and dying; show how the creative leads to synthesis, and the tyrant to stagnancy.)*

*(mostly in this section we are talking about shared structures / cathedrals. cathedrals are also talked about in the last section)*

Castles are structured to contain the chaos that they encounter.

Castles wish to continue growing and building themselves. We can further define that the order of the castle may be dynamic quality orientated. Or it may be quantity orientated. Quantity orientated can become tyrannical in its self-replication, whereas quality orientated is creative and more open to restructuring. Quantity increases the reach of possible actions and quality increases the set of known actions.

|  | **Quantity** (increases Possibilities) |  |
|---|---|---|
|  | **Dis-ordered** | **Ordered** |
| **Quality** (Increases known actions) | **Un-chaotic** | Zombie | Tyrant |
|  | **Chaotic** | Punk | Creative |

Punk and zombie configurations present no challenge to the tyrant and the creative. It is the Tyrant and the creative structure that is in an endless battle. They are the two great forces that reach for freedom: Creative order and pathological order.

This is a dynamic within each of us but it also plays out in ideology and social dynamics. There is a pendulum that swings between the two over history.

Alexander the great conquered half the world as did the Persian Empire before him, the bloody and power hungry nations unified many countries. Eventually leading to great growth in the sharing of knowledge as seen in the library of Alexandria. Tyrannical order gave way to a creative one.

Existence appears to have a self-righting mechanism. However, many front-on attempts to confront tyranny (or pathological order) in the pursuit of freedom only result in another tyranny. Pushing this to the extreme we can consider the motives of the Nazis in the Second World War. Out of an impulse to remove the tyranny of debt, Nazi Germany arose (a simplification I know). Anti-Semitism is misplaced anti-banking and debt trading, the real problem is the way banks control ever more of the people's assets. Out of an impulse for freedom for Germany came pathological acts of control and ordering.

The invisibles is a comic book created by Grant Morrison. There are many planes of reality simultaneously existing together. Magic, aliens, time travel, soul travel, gods, angels, psychics, robots etc etc. the landscape that the characters swim in is constantly changing. All that stays the same is the two forces that are battling each other, one of pathological order and one of freedom. Both sides use any technology or magic they can. The invisibles are an eclectic mix of individuals with various abilities operating mostly with their own volition and ideas. The invisibles are battling against interdimensional alien gods that have a hierarchical system of control and have already enslaved most of the human race without their knowledge. Grant Morrison created three volumes of this comic as a super sigil to help wake up and save humanity from the forces of domination.

For some reason there is an intersection between major contemporary wizards and comic book creators. Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, and Jodorowski all openly profess their love and use of magic. After the tragedy of dune Jodorowski began to create comic books, he could move even faster and further through ideas, as the artist would only be limited by their pen rather than costly movie production. With Jean Giraud drawing he created the Incal, an epic multiplanetary - multi-dimensional space opera. Themes include spiritual transformation, eternal return, mystical symbolism and Tarot. And the battle continues between "uniformity and diversity" or pathological order and freedom

[Images: Pages from Jodorowsky, Alejandro, and Moebius. The Incal. Epic Comics, 1988]

These examples of science fiction are indicative of an eternal struggle between pathological and creative freedom. The protagonists and to a greater extent the authors live in a way that is "excellent", increasing freedom and the expansion of consciousness through imagination. The more links they or we can integrate, the further one can expand, in a sea of consciousness that is without bounds, breaking out of any reality tunnel or matrix that is restricting one.

If existence is pure consciousness, with stories embedded in myths embedded in stories, then life becomes a kind of game. The universe and imagination spontaneously erupt infinitely, let's embrace this life with joy: "party on dudes"
