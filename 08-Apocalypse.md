# Apocalypse

## The Call of the Final Destination

The apocalypse is a force that comes towards us from the future. It is a retroactive force that ripples out from an unknown event of becoming. The event is the full realisation of potential; the idealised castle structure. The event is obfuscated but its effects are visible and felt as a tidal wave.

It is something that calls to us from the future much like aliens. It is a time paradox. As the hyperspheric castle inflows and outflows, tidal waves pass it, one after the other over eons. This is a force from the future that is acting on our castle in the present. There is a super tidal wave, on its way through time, growing towards the castle. The waves are sent from the sun, they are also solar flares. The castle simultaneously falls towards these waves, drawn as if towards a black hole. As it falls through each wave the castle is restructured. An image of all previous water is contained in the wave; it is a retroactive force.

## Tidal Wave

> "We can find all the teachings of Theosophy in the Apocalypse" — Steiner

### The Dream of Atlantis

I had a dream of the end of Atlantis, a large sphere descended from the sky, it was simultaneously a comet and also a spaceship designed to destroy the world. We created a technological race and they conspired against us with a few of our own. The perpetrators had an underground Romanesque city to protect them from the apocalypse, connected to the surface by an umbilical cord.

We were all destroyed in seconds, however we escaped death by turning into water. We, the liquid ones, could shape back and forth between water and a more humanistic form. We gathered in small communities on the outskirts of the underground city. I found myself in an ancient courtyard with old trees, surrounded by arches with crumbling bricks.

### The Apocalypse as Imagination

The apocalypse presents us with a series of images. And it is through eating these images and transforming our astral body that we can transform our etheric and physical bodies.

The imagination is a tool of the knowledge seeker. According to Steiner, the images that can be received are not arbitrary. Steiner places imagination as a stepping block to intuition and inspiration. Terrence McKenna builds thought images, through the use of language but nonetheless, images. We see his image of the apocalypse as the transcendental object at the end of time; the singularity that speaks to us and gravitates us towards it.

### Cyclical Time

The apocalypse can almost be seen as a comforting device, placing time within a structure, in a perhaps more graspable paradigm than a continuous infinity. Perhaps this is why it is a recurring symbol in so many cultures. 2012 was regarded as the end date of the 5126 year long Mayan Calendar (Mesoamerican Long Count calendar), and Terrance McKenna joined in on this prediction via his Time wave theory of increasing novelty. The revelation (apocalypse) of St. John is seen by some as a prediction for the future. Some "Hindu cosmologies describe a universe that is cyclical or oscillating and infinite in time. The universe is described as a cosmic egg that cycles between expansion and total collapse. It expanded from a concentrated form — a point called a Bindu. The universe, as a living entity, is bound to the perpetual cycle of birth, death, and rebirth." Theosophy and Anthroposophy also sees a series of worlds and epochs that come to an end, often through cataclysmic events. However these worlds are part of a process over eons of cosmic evolution.

### Steiner's Reading of Revelation

Rudolf Steiner gives us a reading of St. John's Revelation, in his lecture series *Reading the Pictures of the Apocalypse*, as an image of the future of evolution. As well as it being a text of initiation, giving us an image of the structure of the human, as it is and can be. Steiner sees images as appropriate modes for conveying knowledge of higher realms and deeper truths, which often cannot be put into words: "The Apocalypse is a cosmic explanation of the world. The author was an initiate. He spoke of universal laws that apply to the world from the beginning to the decline, from the alpha to the omega."

> "We should allow the holy symbols given in the Apocalypse to work upon us. The sign of the Sun intelligence, for example, should not remain a mere sign for us; we should immerse ourselves in this sign until we feel it is no longer dead but flowing with life. The signs should be for us doors connecting the physical to the spiritual world. Then we have fulfilled our duty: to connect the physical and the spiritual worlds."

For Steiner the human is made up of four bodies, the physical, etheric, astral and spiritual. There is also the bull, the lion, the eagle and the lamb, which correspond to our willing, feeling, thinking, and ego.

> "In the second vision John sees the four apocalyptic living beings…. The fourfold nature of human generic souls is characterized by the four living creatures of the Apocalypse: lion, bull, eagle, and Man. The lower human being is portrayed through these four living creatures, and the lamb symbolized the perfected human being — that is, the fifth living creature."

### The Hierarchies and Human Evolution

There are several hierarchies of beings of which humans are the 10th, included above us are all the gods from mythology including Christ and Yahweh but they are one of many. Other hierarchies evolve as well, and lower hierarchies will one day be greater than the higher hierarchies as they have been able to transform lower states of matter into their multifold bodies. Within this context Steiner talks of human evolution, specifically the entrance of the I into the human: "An age began when the secret mysteries became accessible to everyone through the mystery of Golgotha, which was placed in the center of the world. The chosen priests and kings gradually cease to exist. A final state is pointed to wherein everyone is a priest and a king, a state wherein all distinctions are swept away and all human beings are made equal. Therefore, the Apocalypse speaks of: "... a Kingdom, priests to his God and Father." (Rev. 1:6)."

In Steiner's world conception the Christian God isn't worshiped as they don't exist yet, instead this Christian conception of god is seen as something that is at the end point of evolution, and it is sometimes this end point that is referred to when Steiner uses the word god in prayer.

### The Astral Plane as Glass Sea

Steiner continues to unpack the Apocalypse of St. John: "Then a number of pictures lead us to the astral plane. We see groups of beings undergoing transformation in the astral light: "... and he who sat there appeared like jasper and carnelian, and, round the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald." (Rev. 4:3) "And before the throne there is as it were a sea of glass, like crystal." (Rev. 4:6) The quality and being of the astral light is indicated by the transparency. In the astral light we can see through objects; they appear like glass. The entire astral world is like a glass sea."

In trying to understand four dimensions. We first would imagine a civilization of flat land in 2 dimensions, anything that lies on the plane around the flatlander obscures their view, however for someone that can see in 3d, such as us, all points, lines and shapes on the 2d plane would be visible. Then we could imagine an alien with 4 dimensional vision (5 including time), they would be able to see through 3d space as we know it, in effect seeing all our organs and bones etc. it would effectively be like a sea of glass. Perhaps moving towards the nagual/astral we may encounter more and more dimensions as we approach the 11 dimensional space of string field theory, where strings vibrate in 11D producing a kind of music that shapes matter. String theory is our best and most comprehensive working theory for how the universe operates, which makes its predictions all the more exciting. Along with multiple universes, String theory predicts the formation of branes (from the word membrane), which have the potential to grow to enormous size, even to the size of the universe. Our universe may then exist on the surface of one of these branes, and the big bang may have happened when another brane collided with ours.

### Future Photosynthesis

We will look at one more alchemical image from the apocalypse. Via Steiner one last time:

> "The alchemy of the human being is this: what the plants do for us today, human beings in the future will be able to accomplish within and through their consciousness. What is outside the human being today will be intertwined within the physical body when we have taken in the entire plant world, when we have expanded our consciousness to include the entire world of plants. That is the future condition of humanity. Then, what exists outside in the natural world surrounding us will be entirely different.

We will be able to photosynthesize in the future and we will also have a system inside us that will use carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, much like plants do now.

As the cosmic egg cycles between expansion and total collapse we move through cycles of separations and reintegrations or revelations. Synthesis of antithesis takes place as other hierarchies interact with our own: the Christ 'I' synthesizing into our bodies, and the future plants that will live inside us along with the tree of life that is already present in the branches of our blood vessels. We are pulled towards the increasing simultaneity, novelty, and complexity. Through the McKenna Lens: "I think of history as a kind of mass psychedelic experience. The drug is technology, and as technology gets more and more perfected as a mirror of the human mind, the cultural experiences become more and more hallucinatory."

## Solar Flare

### Sun Gazing and the Cross

I felt the tidal wave today, as I was outside weeing on the lemon tree, I closed my eyelids and looked towards the sun. Visions and patterns played across my vision and I knew I was being called through time.

The electromagnetic solar wind reaches out to all beings in the solar system and guides them, like a massive brain sending pulses through its neurons.

An image of the cross is present in many pre-Christian cultures, Steiner believes this is to do with the way the sun and the earth hold us: as we stand on the earth the gravity of the sun pulls us up, while the gravity of the earth pulls us down. The east and west horizons give us the horizontal pole of the cross, this is repeated by Don Juan in *Tales Of Power*: "Do you know that at this very moment you are surrounded by eternity? And do you know that you can use that eternity, if you so desire?"….."There! Eternity is there!" he said, pointing to the horizon. Then he pointed to the zenith. "Or there, or perhaps we can say that eternity is like this." He extended both arms to point to the east and west…"Do you know that you can extend yourself forever in any of the directions I have pointed to?" he went on. "Do you know that one moment can be eternity? This is not a riddle; it's a fact, but only if you mount that moment and use it to take the totality of yourself forever in any direction,". 

This is perhaps part of the reason Steiner equates the sun with Christ. Christ comes to us as an embodiment of the sun, to bring love to the earth, and so transform it giving it freedom and ego.

### The Sun as Love

The solar wind is the voice of Eros calling us towards the future, the transcendent object, pulling us to ever greater hallucination.

The Greeks felt the sun pervading them inwardly; "[They] felt the sun as that which infused Love into the living organism, guiding Eros through the waves of sentient existence." This is the love Steiner also equates with the sun's gravity, a force of love that becomes so great that it creates "negative, sucking matter" inside the sun. This is not a new concept by any means: "[It is] love that moves the Sun and the other stars." This also equates Christ with Apollo "The connection with the sublime Sun spirit, which we have emphasized on a number of occasions, is also apparent in the Greek Apollo idea, for Apollo was the Sun god." 

However I'm not sure how McKenna would feel about Apollo being our transcendental object, so I'm thinking Dionysus also be a go between us and the sun, creating a mercurial membrane of hallucination. In Sloterdijk's *Spheres* he develops a similar love that holds a sphere together, which could quite easily be expanded to include the solar system: "I will develop, more obstinately than usual, the hypothesis that love stories are stories of form, and that every act of solidarity is an act of sphere formation, that is to say the creation of an interior". 

By placing love as the creator of the sphere, it also becomes an essential aspect in being human, and being able to live in the world. As Sloterdijk's spheres of love change scales as the consciousness of the time suits, They could be applied as Steiner points to a shift in the sun's energy at the time of Christ: "Christ stands before us, the Spirit Being who, through the Mystery of Golgotha, united Himself with the Earth. And He says to us: 'Be not dismayed that the Sun has become black; it is black because I, the God of the Sun, am no longer in it; for I have come down and united myself with the Earth.'" 

### The Transformation of Logos

McKenna also identifies this as the time when the logos stopped speaking to us, how then has the logos been transformed? The Logos was probably lost as we moved into the rational age, the logos of the light of Christ that shone down upon us has been transformed, now the logos lives in us as imagination, intuition and inspiration as we cultivate the higher spiritual forces we are to develop. Whilst the light of the sun still shines with the raw light of Apollo, the energy of the absolute, that creates the Dionysian flowers in our mind:

> "In July 1884, at the age of forty, Nietzsche confided to his friend Resa von Schirnhofer that every time he closed his eyes "he saw a profusion of fantastic flowers, twining round each other and constantly growing, changing in shape and colour with exotic opulence, one sprouting wildly out of another". Nietzsche complained that these flowers "never give [him] any peace", and then asked Schirnhofer, "with a disturbing urgency", whether she thought his flowers could be "a symptom of incipient madness".

## Black Hole

> "We are being sucked into the body of eternity" — Terrence McKenna

### The Sun as Black Hole

As we have seen the sun has some similarities to a black hole: "The Sun [is] a hollow space of suction which annihilates everything within it…. Anything brought to it is immediately absorbed and disappears." For our purposes these anatomies of the Tidal wave are all simultaneous truths and interchangeable: A black hole could be better described as a black whole, as the centre isn't really nothing, it is in fact an infinitely dense reality; a singularity containing all information that has entered it, folded up. You can't divide a singularity in two; it is a whole.

### La Chorrera and the Philosopher's Stone

Six months after the death of their mother, McKenna and his brother journeyed into the amazon on a search for the then barely known ayahuasca, upon reaching their destination La Chorera, a rather pleasant valley with no biting insects etc, they did not find ayahuasca, but instead a great deal of psilocybin mushrooms. They proceeded to take extremely high doses over multiple days and recorded their findings. For years to come McKenna would continue to work through the insights that he gained from this experience. They believed at the time that they had discovered the philosopher's stone. And also laid the groundwork for Time wave theory. 

### Time Wave Theory

McKenna's Timewave theory uses the I-Ching to produce an algorithm, and then this algorithm is then placed alongside the timeline of history to "map" variances in complexity. McKenna argues that the history of the universe has been one of ever increasing complexity, it in fact is accelerating, and so, much like the theory of the singularity a la Ray Kurzweil. McKenna also placed the end of history, and the apocalypse or in his words the transcendental object at the end of time, in the year 2012. The transcendental object has been pulling us towards it ever since the universe began. And has perhaps been sending us messages and helping us reach towards it by using plant allies to help download information to us.

### Post-2012: Inside the Event Horizon

This theory is interesting to me particularly because we are now in the year 2025. It is a particularly interesting thought experiment if we take this passing through the apocalypse not as a disproof of Mckenna's theory but rather think how his thoughts may still hold a truth for us. He himself suggested that as we reach the transcendental object novelty/complexity will explode into the infinite, however much like a cosmonaut travelling in their spaceship into a black hole, time will subjectively expand outwards for us, due to relativity. So in effect shouldn't the apocalypse last for infinity? Let's continue McKenna's Black hole metaphor and see where it will lead us.

If the year 2012 represents an event horizon, then after we pass through it we will see everything that has already passed into it, all of the past back to the beginning of time will be presented to us as a simultaneous present. And as we look in the other direction we see everything that will eventually enter into the black hole. If in a traditional black hole, it exists as a camera for that part of the universe and time collapses into it so that it records the history of the universe from its perspective.

History is increasingly known and distributed towards the present. So if we move into this Timewave black hole we see all of knowledge of the past that will enter this post historical period.

### Ghost Horizons

As we pass into a black hole we go through a series of horizons, McKenna called them Ghost Horizons: "I think of this event-horizon as a series of ghost-horizons, [that you pass through as you continue through history]. History is the outer shell of the gravitational field of the attractor of the concrescence." I.e. the singularity.

"There is a curious interface zone that is not the singularity and not the absence of the singularity. It's the singularity in the act of becoming, and it only lasts, as I say, a geological microsecond, 50,000 years."

Let's continue on our journey: "As you pass through the outer horizon, the horizon splits in two, there is no sign that you have crossed the horizon." We have reached a ghost horizon as we traverse history. This can be understood as an event in the physical or mental realm that retroactively changes the past, or brings it into view so that we may see it fully: "There is no way of telling what may yet become part of history. Perhaps the past is still essentially undiscovered! [...] Every great human being exerts a retroactive force: for his sake all of history is placed in balance again, and a thousand secrets of the past crawl out of their hiding places - into his sunshine."

"As you fall deeper inside the horizon, the horizon bubble enlarges." This is the perspective of time from the past warping into view. This is an image of very early magic consciousness developing. Simultaneously it is an image of a growing awareness of the past and a flattening of time that comes with integral-alchemical-final-participatory consciousness.

"As you approach the inner horizon, the black hole ahead stops expanding, and starts to shrink. It looks like you are moving away from the black hole, but that is not true. You are still free-falling inwards, towards the black hole. The shrinking is caused by relativistic beaming, which concentrates the view ahead." So our view of the future also shrinks as we move towards it, this is from the weight of the transcendental object, making it hard to see the future. "The same relativistic beaming causes light from the outside universe to become brighter and more blue-shifted around the black hole." So as the future seems to recede away, the past becomes closer to us, continuing to flatten towards simultaneity.

### Through the Wormhole

"As you fall deeper into the black hole, the inward flow of space is slowed by the gravitational repulsion produced by the negative pressure of the radial electric field." Negative pressure elongates time as we move towards the apocalypse of the second horizon. Time slows down at this point, as the past approaches simultaneity with us and the future seems far away. Then as we pass through the second horizon and we see an image of history-past projected to the now in a blinding light. This blinding light in a black hole contains everything the black hole has ever 'seen', however to comprehend it we would need to be infinitely quick. 

After we pass the second horizon or anti-horizon we enter a period of time that is the worm hole after which we pass out into a white hole we pass back through an anti horizon and we see a blinding image of future history, of the universe we have just come from projected to the now, We may not be capable at the time of deciphering the data presented to us. As we go through the fourth horizon we see an image of the past history of the new universe, in a blinding light. The fourth horizon presents us with an image of the past that we never knew. Perhaps of a new realm such as the astral or the spiritual or a quantum string dimension.

### Infinite Nested Universes

The Big bang has a consistent acceleration of expansion as the birth of a black hole, very quickly at first and then increasingly slower, as stated above "the inward flow of space is slowed by the gravitational repulsion produced by the negative pressure of the radial electric field." and this negative pressure gets bigger as the black hole grows. So some theoretical physicists believe our universe originated in the singularity of the big bang/bounce, and all enclosed in an event horizon. If this is the case there could be an infinite number of universes enclosing one another. "every time a supermassive star collapses in a type II supernova and creates a central black hole, a new, two-dimensional Universe is created"

We may very well pass through a series of black holes as we make our way through history, evolving up the spiritual hierarchies whilst falling through time towards the Transcendental object.

## Sonic Boom

### The Accumulation of History

If we look at our place in time and the evolution of consciousness, we find ourselves moving into post-history and post-rational consciousness. We find ourselves moving towards a final participation (Barfield), and into magic (Alan Moore), in an increasing hallucination of connective technology (McKenna). As we pass into the realm of post-history we find that the interconnections of Magic/alchemy/Shamanism are infinitely more complex, as it now contains the accumulative sonic boom of history. To be a practicing magician now, will be to open ourselves to ever greater depths: "We might have lost the Light and the Height; but more frightening, we have lost the Mystery and the deep, the Emptiness and the Abyss."

### Growing Like Trees

> "keep growing, keep changing, we shed our old bark, we shed our skins every spring, we keep becoming younger, fuller of future, taller, stronger, we push our roots ever more powerfully into the depths - into evil - while at the same time we embrace the heavens ever more lovingly, more broadly, imbibing their light ever more thirstily with all our twigs and leaves.
> 
> Like trees we grow - this is hard to understand, as is all of life - not in one place but everywhere, not in one direction but equally upward and outward and inward and downward; our energy is at work simultaneously in the trunk, branches and roots; we are no longer free to do one particular thing, to be only one particular thing."

## A.I.

### Technology as Human Extension

Artificial intelligence will transform consciousness, much like the invention of fire, the wheel and the printing press. This section also can talk about technology as an essential part of what makes us human, and AI as possibly making us more human. However, there could also be a loss of agency. Much like the monkey who is an automation tool for the magician but can become pathological so can A.I. As the magician becomes increasingly dependent on external systems for decision-making. When the magician cedes control to AI, it risks losing touch with its own inner wisdom, becoming a passive observer rather than an active participant in the unfolding of reality.

The magician must always strive to maintain sovereignty over their own consciousness.

## Living After the Apocalypse

> "We should live as if the apocalypse has already occurred and will happen again." — Terrence McKenna

We are already living in post-apocalyptic times. The event horizon has been crossed. The tidal wave surrounds us. The solar flare illuminates us. We fall through the black hole.

The question is not "when will the apocalypse come?" but rather "how do we navigate the apocalypse we are already within?"

Covid has certainly increased the multiple possible realities that exist in simultaneous contrast. Most people have to choose a side and stay there. However there may be multiple truths existent.

So there is a yearning for the apocalypse/utopia. These are the same thing. We are moving towards strangeness. Which is at once nauseating and orgasmic. Of course I would like to embody love but everything always contains its opposite. Consider the sexual act which is so bodily, our bodies confront us with their blood and guts. Some people are fearful of sex for this reason and have developed defence mechanisms and psychoses; they do not accept the physical side of sex.

The apocalypse is not an ending but a revealing. The word itself means "unveiling" or "revelation." What is being revealed is the true nature of reality—that consciousness is primary, that we are builders of castles, that we are falling through infinite dimensions toward an incomprehensible attractor.

I would like to do my part to increase the speed at which we head towards the singularity of complexity. As I would say it is the evolution of consciousness and the flowering of love. To love is to know. So the intent is talismanic integral art, of unified complexity.

## Author's Notes

This chapter synthesizes multiple apocalyptic visions—mystical, scientific, and visionary—into a coherent framework. The apocalypse is not a single event but a process we are already within. The metaphors of tidal wave, solar flare, and black hole are not merely poetic but point to genuine features of consciousness evolution and the structure of time itself.

Whether McKenna's specific date of 2012 was "correct" is less important than the recognition that we are indeed accelerating toward some kind of singularity—technological, spiritual, or both. The task is to build castles strong enough to withstand and navigate these transformative forces, while remaining open enough to be transformed by them.
