# Foundations

## The Ground of Being

There is absolute nothingness from which arises Infinite mind at large. Evolution, matter, physics and dimensions of time and space all must emerge together. This is because a universe is made of something as opposed to nothing. this something we call matter, and to be matter it must have variation otherwise it would have no meaning, it would be absolutely flat. so we must also have a way of matter interacting with itself which we call physics, which must also occur in dimension. The types of physics, matter and dimension might vary from universe to universe but they are part of the definition of a universe. Evolution must also exist in a universe. as matter is a resource which can be used by a system to make more of itself. matter then tends towards self ordering systems.

So all these parts are present as soon as there is a witness. i.e. mind at large.

The ground of being is the mind at large, it is the infinite witness. Infinite consciousness. It is so unified that it lacks the ability to see itself from one point. Over time systems of matter emerge which are local by definition. they become structured and an aspect of the infinite witness can become extruded and gain perspective. This perspective is then gifted back to the infinite mind in order to enrich it and generate better extrusions. We humans are an outcome of this process, and there is much further to go. Each extrusion contains more structure between physical and witness. our higher self Or "I" is the latest addition to extrusion, and as such it is our most powerful and our most underdeveloped. eventually we may use it to restructure all other developed layers.

Infinite consciousness has all the answers but lacks the ability to ask questions. Whereas dissociated human consciousness acquires perspective and the ability to question.

Active Imagination is the bridge between Mind at Large and the individual self. It is the process of inquiry—the act of asking questions and listening for answers. Through this process, we shape our realities, linking ideas to form new structures of experience. Imagination is not idle fantasy but the mechanism of world creation. When we illuminate something previously unseen, we are not merely discovering—we are participating in the act of creation itself.

This interplay between discovery and creation is evident in every moment of perception. If I see a rock and turn it over to examine what lies beneath, the act of revealing is an act of world-building. The question I ask—"What does me + the spacetime position of this rock equal?"—is met with an answer that is filtered through my belief system, my framework of reality.

Mind at Large seeks to know itself, yet it can only do so through us—through individuated consciousness shining a light into the unknown. We are not passive observers but active participants in the unfolding of infinity. The world we experience is drawn from an infinite field of possibilities, shaped by the questions we ask and the dimensions we choose to explore.

If we limit our questions simply to our position of Cartesian space-time we limit the range of answers from the infinite. We need to combine ideas such as philosophy, economics, spirituality, mysticism, magic, and above all the knowledge that all of this including space-time is an illusion. The more dimensions we explore the further our spectrum of consciousness will reach.

The Ground of Being is limitless, but it requires explorers to give it shape. Our task is not just to witness, but to extrude, embody, and create—to bring forth new realities from the boundless potential of Mind at Large.

## The primacy of the imagination

> "We shouldn't talk about fantastic literature because we don't know to what genre the universe belongs; if it is fantastic or real" — Borges

Given that we are accepting Bernardo Kastrup's Idealist ontology where Mind is everything, the importance of imagination is readily apparent. Imagination is the process of structuring, not merely leisurely pursuit of escapist fantasy. It is the very bedrock of experience. It is the process by which the world is made available to us; the process by which the castle is structured. Coleridge calls this the primary imagination. This differentiates itself from secondary imagination and fantasy. Secondary imagination we would call fine art. And fantasy is zombie replication, or stagnating unspeaking art.

Husserl would call primary imagination the natural attitude, "the spontaneous belief that the world which is there is simply given." Husserl would add that a shift could be made in primary imagination, once we observe that seeing is actually an act of creating. This shift he calls the epoché, the temporary suspension of belief. So his contribution is that becoming aware of the fabrication of the world, allows us to see the world, without being lost in it. Furthermore, to become aware of the creative act may give us some agency over this force.

Is reality mind or matter? Most materialists would suggest that our perception of consciousness is an illusion, and is simply a product of evolutionary forces and deterministic neurons firing. This argument is full of paradox, it uses mind to argue against mind. Furthermore the very idea of observable material itself is undermined if we follow out the logic of natural selection. Donald D. Hoffman uses computer modelling to show us that our perceptions are hallucinations that help us to survive in the world rather than being a perception of an objective reality. "Our perceptions have evolved through natural selection for utility rather than a perception of truth. Seeing the truth isn't efficient."
