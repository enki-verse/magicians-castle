# The Magician & Avatars

## The Magician

The magician is our higher self. our god self, christ self, buddha self. it is a part of us that is very close to formless pure witness. The magician is the first form that arises around an extruded witness. It is often unseen by us as it is newly evolved and only faint. It is something we need to cultivate, a true awareness of self. As opposed to false perception of self awareness, that is actually the robotic monkey self which our mind has created to automate basic function and survival.

The Magician uses the castle to gain perspective over the lands. His/her castle becomes a vessel that may journey over the ground of infinite being. With it, the magician can contemplate, engage or dance with the mind at large, which we observe from our castle, mediated by the theatre of avatars. Upon the death of what we understand as our physical body the castle is subsumed into the earth, the castle will once again become part of the ground of being and mind at large. The wizard may be drowned in this ocean as they re-enter universal consciousness. Their perspective is lost. Agency is sacrificed for communion.

The theatre of awareness resides within the castle, it is the area of which we are conscious. The rest of the castle is an unconscious background for the theatre.

The eye of the witness resides in the magician, who is often unaware of their own presence. If they are able to listen to themselves they will unlock profound wisdom. This is our genius, our higher self. This is synonymous with the genius as understood in ancient Rome, however at that time it was still thought of as a being outside of ourselves, which we experience as part of ourselves. nonetheless it is the same thing.

The magician ego is something which has a portal into the logos, that is, a network of egos that communicate directly without the need to pass through the physical world. Sometimes this sounds like our own voice and sometimes it is the voice of another.

when a psychotic is hearing voices though they have begun to see their magician as other and their monkey as self. This can lead to a rejection of self and a darkening of that ego into a spiteful god.

*(poetic but not sure if it adds here: Although to live most fully is to climb the mountain our energy comes from the sea. We constantly call from the mountain to hear what the ocean has to say in return. As we listen to it we are filled with life force to climb higher and sing even more beautiful questions.)*

A wizard never leaves his/her castle; they are connected to it in a symbiotic relationship. Even if a castle has been "driven" across the land right next to another castle, the wizards cannot communicate directly, as that would require emerging from the castle which is not possible until death. Instead communication between wizards is only achieved through the summoning or casting of avatars. The avatar will visit the magician at each other's castle. And becomes part of their theatre to varying degrees.

When I read a book, avatars come to my castle. When I interact with you, your avatar, and the avatars that make up our conversation come to my castle.

A Magician has the ability to pull avatars out of everything in the physical universe. The power of their mind and imagination brings life to all things, all things are given a voice.

A good spell will create a strong avatar. It will be highly living and highly restructuring. Its beauty will allow it entrance to a castle and allow it to integrate. an even better spell is a collection of avatars, like a circus troupe.

**Summoning** - bring to your castle - may involve physical action but can be done purely mentally

**Casting** - send to others castles. Requires physical action to create informational energy to appear in another wizard's castle.

Castles are infectious. A living castle may enliven another.

**Monkey mind** = self generated zombie avatar. This is an avatar we have created in our own image which the light of consciousness often mistakes for the magician. In reality there may be many false conceptions of self, monkey's zombies or other forms. but for simplicity's sake we will just use the metaphor of "the monkey". When the Monkey wears the crown the castle withers. It becomes stagnant. It does however still produce avatars unconsciously and these may infect other surrounding castles. The monkey avatar self has no imagination. They do not have the ability to integrate the chaos which constantly surrounds us. And as we know if we do not integrate it both chaos and order may become pathological.

## Avatars

A magician interacts with the world through avatars. He can never see another magician directly nor can he see the ground of being directly (mind at large). He only sees the avatars that they create. Consciousness does not directly meet other consciousness, certainly not in a physical or mental way at any rate. And nor does our consciousness meet mind at large. When you meet someone you instead meet their image presented to you. They have "cast" their image through their presence and their action or inaction. This can be in the form of: painting, speaking, dancing, writing. Even when we are sleeping our body is generating an avatar of its image which is received by others.

This image or avatar then travels across the ground of being to your castle where it is escorted by your own avatars to meet your magician. Avatars are never solo, always multiple, always in dialogue. The avatars generated by the ground of being include space, time, and all matter. The image of the neuron firing represents the physical understanding of a thought. The image of stars and planets revolving represents the physical understanding of mind at large.

In addition to casting a wizard may also summon: When we take an action that generates a new avatar, by looking at art, reading, consuming any media, or by imagining.

it is worth investigating two types of avatars: both non verbal (thought forms) and verbal (voices)

In terms of painting practice the psychic landscape may encompass either verbal or non-verbal avatars. In the above example I would say it leans more towards non-verbal rather than the narrative stages of history painting that include the verbal iconography of personages (see the picnic at the end of time)
