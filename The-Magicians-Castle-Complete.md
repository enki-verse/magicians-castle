# Introduction

## Why this book?

This book is an instruction manual for freedom. Presenting a view of what is the landscape of reality and what can be achieved within it. The universal framework of consciousness and our unique "theatre of awareness". 

The universal framework is the castle, upon which have built our unique perspective, often shaped by cultural, biological, and metaphysical forces beyond our awareness.

It confronts the forces that shape the theatre's construction and offers tools for individuals to restructure their own theatre, optimizing them for personal freedom rather than conforming to the worldviews of the many cultural "cults" in which we grow up

Mind and matter are not separate; they are one. We experience ourselves in physical bodies, but these bodies and the world around us are expressions of mind. Through movement, storytelling, ritual, and all forms of embodied experience, Mind manifests itself. Embodiment is the actualization of mind.

Across cultures, various costumes and "masks" designate power and significance. These rituals embody the ideas most important to their cultures. For many, this is fulfilling. People find richness in the intricate layers of their inherited cultural embodiments: the Body of Christ, the totem animal, or other sacred symbols. Others, however, find themselves in post-religious, consumerist cultures with their own rituals—sports, music festivals, branding—which often lack the same depth of useful meaning.

For myself and many others, we find ourselves without a clear cultural position, either through migration or exploration of new paradigms. This absence is both a loss and a gift. Without a secure foundation, we face uncertainty. Yet it also opens a vast space for creative freedom—the possibility of building something better. This freedom allows us to take what works for us and develop it into something personal and transformative. We call this process mythology unbound.

Many paradigms of the past have been self-sustaining to the point of limiting the freedom of their disciples. They propagate themselves at the expense of individual potential. These are the cathedrals of cults, religions, materialism, and consumerism, wokism and conservatism —structures designed to perpetuate their own existence.

The opportunity before us is to create reality tunnels that minimize self-propagation and optimize for personal freedom. Could we make a "cult" about breaking out of cults? An anarchist matrix?

This is why we must find meaningful movements and embodiments to support the worlds we wish to create. Like the great cathedrals, paradigms, and rituals of the past, we must cast our visions into being.

We would reclaim the power of mythology, visionary art and ritual movement and all forms of integrated spiritual material. and use them to give ourselves the power of the gods. to be creators of our own reality.

you may read this and be questioning our sanity but we assure you we have clear eyes. we know we cannot fly..... but a time is coming soon when we can.

## Idealism

Before we go further we should explain that idealism is taken by us as given. This book is built upon the foundation of Idealism—the understanding that consciousness is fundamental, and what we perceive as the material world is its extrinsic appearance. Materialism assumes that consciousness arises from physical structures, yet it cannot explain how subjective experience emerges from unconscious matter. Neuroscience has shown that deep meditative states, near-death experiences, and psychedelics often result in heightened awareness despite suppressed brain activity, suggesting that consciousness is not merely a product of neural computation.

If mind is primary, then the world we experience is not an objective, mind-independent reality, but rather a shared projection of consciousness. Bernardo Kastrup proposes that what we call the "physical world" is simply the outer appearance of mental activity, much like how neurons in a brain are the physical correlate of thoughts and emotions. Just as an individual's conscious experiences are expressed through the body, the universe itself may be the extrinsic appearance of a vast transpersonal consciousness—Mind at Large. In this view, our sense of separateness is an illusion created by dissociation, much like how individuals with dissociative identity disorder experience multiple selves within a single mind.

This perspective aligns with both quantum mechanics and ancient spiritual traditions. The observer effect in quantum physics suggests that reality does not take a definite form until it is observed, undermining the idea of a world that exists independently of consciousness. If perception shapes reality at the most fundamental level, then mind is not something trapped inside the body—it is the very fabric of existence itself.

This book takes Idealism to its natural conclusion: if all is mind, then meaning is not an arbitrary human construct but an intrinsic feature of reality. Unlike religions that seek to transcend suffering by escaping the body, I argue that the purpose of existence is embodiment—the extrusion of mind into understanding. We are not here to dissolve back into an undifferentiated void, but to create, experience, and refine structures that give shape to being.

Rather than viewing existence as something to be endured or escaped, we reclaim it as an act of creative participation. To live is to build, to extrude, to embody. Mind at Large, in its vast and formless state, lacks perspective; it is through our differentiation, our pain, our enjoyment and our unique experiences that the infinite gains self-awareness. We are not here to escape the world—we are here to become it.

## Visualising Reality

The majority of this book will present a physical representation of reality that is understandable to extruded consciousness, in order that we may navigate and evolve. We present reality as a castle of ontology. Which can be divided into three parts. These metaphors are the ground, the castle, and the magician. Each works in a process with the others.

**The Ground:** An image of the mind at large—the infinite consciousness we experience and translate as the universe.

**The Castle:** an extrusion out of the ground of being. An alter that has become dissociated from mind at large, and therefore has an ego. A castle is a dynamic ontological map representing the manifold structures and experiences of being. The castle holds our experience, which is the theatre of awareness: a vast collection of avatars that are in various states of connection and interaction with one another.

**The Magician:** Our higher self, the creative consciousness that inhabits the castle. The magician receives and creates avatars, which both construct the castle and journey outward to engage with other castles. The magician is the first envelope of the light of consciousness, which illuminates all other avatars including the monkey. The monkey is a tool of the magician which the light of consciousness often mistakes for the magician as it produces internal monologue. The magician evolves the castle whilst the monkey stagnates it.

These metaphors will serve as the foundation for a deeper exploration into the process of navigating infinite being and the coming apocalypse culminating in "real-world outcomes."

This journey invites you to question, imagine, and participate actively in the creation of reality.

# Foundations

## The Ground of Being

There is absolute nothingness from which arises Infinite mind at large. Evolution, matter, physics and dimensions of time and space all must emerge together. This is because a universe is made of something as opposed to nothing. this something we call matter, and to be matter it must have variation otherwise it would have no meaning, it would be absolutely flat. so we must also have a way of matter interacting with itself which we call physics, which must also occur in dimension. The types of physics, matter and dimension might vary from universe to universe but they are part of the definition of a universe. Evolution must also exist in a universe. as matter is a resource which can be used by a system to make more of itself. matter then tends towards self ordering systems.

So all these parts are present as soon as there is a witness. i.e. mind at large.

The ground of being is the mind at large, it is the infinite witness. Infinite consciousness. It is so unified that it lacks the ability to see itself from one point. Over time systems of matter emerge which are local by definition. they become structured and an aspect of the infinite witness can become extruded and gain perspective. This perspective is then gifted back to the infinite mind in order to enrich it and generate better extrusions. We humans are an outcome of this process, and there is much further to go. Each extrusion contains more structure between physical and witness. our higher self Or "I" is the latest addition to extrusion, and as such it is our most powerful and our most underdeveloped. eventually we may use it to restructure all other developed layers.

Infinite consciousness has all the answers but lacks the ability to ask questions. Whereas dissociated human consciousness acquires perspective and the ability to question.

Active Imagination is the bridge between Mind at Large and the individual self. It is the process of inquiry—the act of asking questions and listening for answers. Through this process, we shape our realities, linking ideas to form new structures of experience. Imagination is not idle fantasy but the mechanism of world creation. When we illuminate something previously unseen, we are not merely discovering—we are participating in the act of creation itself.

This interplay between discovery and creation is evident in every moment of perception. If I see a rock and turn it over to examine what lies beneath, the act of revealing is an act of world-building. The question I ask—"What does me + the spacetime position of this rock equal?"—is met with an answer that is filtered through my belief system, my framework of reality.

Mind at Large seeks to know itself, yet it can only do so through us—through individuated consciousness shining a light into the unknown. We are not passive observers but active participants in the unfolding of infinity. The world we experience is drawn from an infinite field of possibilities, shaped by the questions we ask and the dimensions we choose to explore.

If we limit our questions simply to our position of Cartesian space-time we limit the range of answers from the infinite. We need to combine ideas such as philosophy, economics, spirituality, mysticism, magic, and above all the knowledge that all of this including space-time is an illusion. The more dimensions we explore the further our spectrum of consciousness will reach.

The Ground of Being is limitless, but it requires explorers to give it shape. Our task is not just to witness, but to extrude, embody, and create—to bring forth new realities from the boundless potential of Mind at Large.

## The primacy of the imagination

> "We shouldn't talk about fantastic literature because we don't know to what genre the universe belongs; if it is fantastic or real" — Borges

Given that we are accepting Bernardo Kastrup's Idealist ontology where Mind is everything, the importance of imagination is readily apparent. Imagination is the process of structuring, not merely leisurely pursuit of escapist fantasy. It is the very bedrock of experience. It is the process by which the world is made available to us; the process by which the castle is structured. Coleridge calls this the primary imagination. This differentiates itself from secondary imagination and fantasy. Secondary imagination we would call fine art. And fantasy is zombie replication, or stagnating unspeaking art.

Husserl would call primary imagination the natural attitude, "the spontaneous belief that the world which is there is simply given." Husserl would add that a shift could be made in primary imagination, once we observe that seeing is actually an act of creating. This shift he calls the epoché, the temporary suspension of belief. So his contribution is that becoming aware of the fabrication of the world, allows us to see the world, without being lost in it. Furthermore, to become aware of the creative act may give us some agency over this force.

Is reality mind or matter? Most materialists would suggest that our perception of consciousness is an illusion, and is simply a product of evolutionary forces and deterministic neurons firing. This argument is full of paradox, it uses mind to argue against mind. Furthermore the very idea of observable material itself is undermined if we follow out the logic of natural selection. Donald D. Hoffman uses computer modelling to show us that our perceptions are hallucinations that help us to survive in the world rather than being a perception of an objective reality. "Our perceptions have evolved through natural selection for utility rather than a perception of truth. Seeing the truth isn't efficient."

# The Castle

## The Castle

The structure of experience is a castle, a spatial construction of consciousness extruded from mind at large. Mind at large is both mind and physical, a single substance like a Möbius strip that appears to have two sides but is truly one. However extrusions, or castles, join witness and physical without using a Mobius strip, instead forming a structured chain of being. Over time, castles have evolved, growing in complexity from plants to animals to humans. Within an individual's lifetime, the castle's structure can shift as our understanding of the world transforms.

Our extrusions contain many qualities in common with other extrusions, especially with our fellow human extrusions. Any metabolising being is extruded, but humans are more structured and potent.

the castle localises mind at large, building a bridge between the local witness and physical reality. For humans we form a higher self around our witness, and around that we form a world conception along with a lower self or a monkey self. This then acts upon a further link that is an energetic medium, or a powerful zone of unconsciousness, before it reaches physical reality as we know it.

Within this structure in humans, there is vast room for customisation. the higher self or ego may be barely there or very strong. the lower self can be in service of the higher self, or it can be a zombie tyrant. There is variance in our emotional understanding of the world, our experience of time and space, variance in life force, our pattern recognition, and so on. but out of all these our world conception varies the most widely.

The world conception is visualised as a grand theatre inside the castle. The structure of the theatre is often changing. There are so many ways for the world to be understood. Whole worlds may exist within this theatre which is vast and cavernous. someone living in a highly animistic or deeply mythological framework that predates organized religion or abstract philosophy will construct a theatre where nature is alive and full of spirits. someone deeply embedded in hyper-rationalism or scientism, where materialism defines reality, and spirituality is dismissed, will have a very different stage, one that is perhaps more representative of modern culture. Finally someone that blends technological and spiritual paradigms, embracing integration through futuristic or transhumanist lenses and spotlights will have another stage construction built, for their own purpose, to find the patterns they are looking for.

The Infinite consciousness of the ground of being contains all the answers but it lacks the ability to see itself, and it also lacks the ability to ask questions. We perceive the ground of being as the physical universe. Our castle is temporarily catalysed and extricated out of the universal net, gaining perspective and partially losing our connectedness. The higher from the earth we grow the more perspective we have, but the harder it is for us to connect to our rhizomatic and mycelial roots, this is what we must do however, and we must do it in two ways, by feeling down into our depths, and by watching from our position of perspective the infinite mycelial net that surrounds us. We must do both at once otherwise we will move into the pre-rational Dionysian or the rational Apollonian. We must be like the centaur; its lower body is its connection to dream, its head and hands pointing at the target.

## The Theatre

### Hyperspheric shadow

Hyperspheric thinking extends within experience to all the layers of reality we experience: the universe, galaxy, solar system, Earth, and the Human Body.

History is a series of black holes holding other black holes, universes in universes. The present is another universe, birthed by all previous eras, the latest baby babushka doll. And simultaneously, evolution envelops the past retroactively. Our reptilian brain is enveloped by our mammalian brain, which is enveloped by our neocortex; archaic consciousness is enveloped by mythic consciousness, which is enveloped by rational consciousness, which is enveloped by a post-rational consciousness. Past and future forms of consciousness can be seen as simultaneous interiors and exteriors. So we are in a hyperspheric universe, and to visualise and understand the structure of experience, we see dynamic hyperspheric allegories.

Let us try and understand the hypersphere: As we move through the dimensions from a 0D point, to a 1D line (with 2 points), to a 2D square (with 4 points), and a 3D cube (with 8 points), we reach another theoretical dimension, the 4D, and its object along this progression, the hyper cube (with 16 points). Just as each previous dimension added has doubled the existing points and structure, so too does the 4th dimension; the cube stretches out into the fourth dimension. The hypercube is visualised in 3d space as a cube that engulfs another cube but that is simultaneously engulfed by that cube. This 3d visualisation can be further understood by animation, just like a torus or hair scrunchy can revolve so that the outside becomes the inside, so can a hypercube, except that with a hyper cube there isn't negative and positive space, it's all positive, so imagine the negative space of a scrunchy also being filled in. one negative space each in the middle, top and bottom of the scrunchy, and one on the left, right, forward and back. We can see there exists 7 cubes within a hyper cube, and each one could be folded into the centre of the 3d visualisation of the hypercube space.

A hyperspace is a good way to visualise our castle, as our cube of reference can shift, and each enfolder can become brought into focus and visualised by the witness in its time.

The history of the universe can be seen as a generation of further enfoldings through time. Atoms exist first and soon generate molecules, which enfold them, and then single cell organisms which enfold atoms, then neuronal organisms, neural cord organisms, the reptilian brain stem, the limbic system, and the neo cortex enfolds all of these previous levels.

These states of evolution also correspond to the evolution of consciousness locomotive=neural cord, archaic= neo cortex, magic = complex neo cortex, and then we get to further states of consciousness, and each state encompasses the last: Magic, mythic, rational, and Centauric. Or socially: village, empire, nation, and planetary. You get the picture… maybe. Anyway the main thing to grasp is how the next level must encompass the last.

At the same time we find ourselves unfolding in the other direction. We find our complex systems of life in the biosphere of the earth, in the solar system, in the galaxy, in the universe, which is perhaps one in a multiverse pea and ham soup type situation. So this complexity finds itself on the inside, as opposed to the outside that the neocortex finds itself on.

If we move to the human experience of the present, we may see that time enfolds in both directions: The now surrounds all previous time while at once being surrounded by all previous time. We are shaped by time, but we also retroactively change time by our decisions, actions, and perhaps most importantly our creations.

Rudolf Steiner introduced an idea of Counterspace that I believe describes the six enfolding cubes of the central cube in the hypercube. Counterspace can be seen as the mirror image of Euclidean space. Instead of the plane at infinity, the point is at infinity. Everywhere is the centre. An example of this is his picture of the head torso and limbs of the human being. Steiner takes Goethe's theories of morphology as a casting off point. Noting Goethe's experience of finding a lamb's skull in a field and on observation coming to conclusion that the forms of the skull can be seen as morphed vertebrae. Steiner takes the image of a morphed skull into the limbs of the human, and asks us to imagine a sock being turned inside out, thus the limb bone is an inverted skull. The skull is a complete image of itself, forming a complete sphere; the torso is only a partial physicalisation of its true soul sphere form, but once we reach the limbs the bones have been turned inside out, and the entire universe is the sphere, the limbs are a tiny slither of a physicalized plane that forms the circumference of a sphere that's origin is located everywhere/in infinity. Steiner has given us another example of Counterspace, and we may also draw from this human image one of the Castle. Because the castle describes all levels of our reality: the universe, galaxy, solar system, Earth, and the Human Body.

This image of the human places the head as purely body, the torso as body and soul, and the limbs as body soul and spirit. This is yet another example of a simultaneous reversal of structure, instead of the traditional understanding of the head being our most evolved/perfected aspect.

## Evolving world conceptions

There is a clear ontological progression that takes place with individuals and civilisations. We begin with a single foundation stone; this lifts us out of the unified ground of being. The stone also acts as our sense organ, which at this early stage is one dimensional and minimal bandwidth. A baby sends out impulses and sees what they receive. Out of a chaotic soup of sense perceptions rhythms begin to emerge. Allowing the child to begin to differentiate. Differentiation allows categorisation and navigation. Space and primitive time are unlocked. We extend our limbs into the world and open new sense organs. Our castle becomes a basic home with doors and windows and a roof. It has successfully lifted the magician out of the soup of infinite being. For example we might have a simple teepee for our castle, with a gravitational pull of love that holds everything down. While a tensile strength of pragmatic enquiry stops the castle from collapsing. The magician may now receive and summon avatars to further aid in the construction of the castle.

When it is healthy the castle is in a constant state of restructuring. Avatars integrate with the structure around them as they enter the castle.

As the castle grows and integrates further dimensions or paradigms it becomes harder to visualise. It moves beyond the 3 dimensional into the hyperspheric.

As the castle grows it transforms, evolving through various structures. As the castle evolves it swings back and forth between chaos and order. New chaos is continually integrated into the body of the castle, i.e. order. The castle moves from pre-rational, to rational, to post-rational, to neo-rational.

| Pre-rational | rational | Post-rational | Neo-rational |
|--------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| disassociated chaos | structured | dislocated clusters of structure/paradigms | integrated multi paradigm structure |
| (antithesis) | thesis (synthesis) | antithesis | synthesis (thesis) |

Out of a magical shamanic past humankind went through a period of Euclidean hierarchy building in religion and science, after which post-structuralist and post-modern thought popped the bubbles; exploding the structures of the past into a midden heap of diverse paradigms with no apparent hierarchical depth. There have been various attempts to re-integrate these paradigms into a hypersphere, which is an intermediary structure on our path back to graspability and embodiment. Multiple dimensions of the hypersphere are finally relocated back into Euclidean space; the final structure is the kabbalistic tree, wherein the previous chaos can be metabolised into something navigable to a perceiving alter.

The castle begins in the most basic form as a pile, a simple form of consciousness, of action and reaction, pleasure and pain. At the second stage the castle becomes rationalised and we learn to delineate. Consciousness becomes more complex as it integrates other paradigms; a process of allowing a chaotic element from the outside of the castle to be integrated and held by its ordering structure. This can continue for a long time, in a human life for much of childhood, until we come across a paradigm that we have not allowed room for in our structure, and if the body of the castle has become calcified it may fracture at this point. This might happen when we come across relativity, or quantum mechanics, or the singularity of the big bang. It might happen if we question the paradigm we are using to build the rest of our structure upon. Say if we question our religion, or the validity of space-time.

At this point our structures may become disassembled. We are left with a midden heap of transcendental signifieds. Upon which ordering structures begin to rebuild whether we are conscious of it or not. And if we don't have a plan we will become part of someone else's plan. We may fall victim to an organising structure that is dictated to us by our consumer society, in which case we will eventually be consumed by the cathedral (chronos, the consuming mother). Or we can begin down a path of awakening and unification which leads first to the hypersphere and then to the Kabbalistic tree of life.

## Stages of consciousness

Thought-space is the picture provided when we construct consciousness spatially. Many types of consciousness are visualised in different ways, resulting in different thought spaces.

This is an alchemical or hallucinogenic way of looking at thought, in that it is associative and morphic. Several theorists have developed the thought space concept: Jean Gebser, Ken Wilber, Peter Sloterdijk, John David Ebert, Deleuze and Guattari all generate spatial images of an evolving consciousness.

Jean Gebser's dimensions of consciousness are dimensional: **Archaic structure** is 0 dimensional, it is the first structure to emerge from "the ever-present origin". **Magic structure** is 1 dimensional, humans have a sense of being separate from the world around them but are not yet in their ego, language emerges as word magic. **Mythic structure** is 2 dimensional, we are now conscious of the other, it is a consciousness of polarities, memory and feeling interact and create religion. **Mental/Rational structure** is 3 dimensional, here we have the Hegelian trinity of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. **Integral structure** is 4 dimensional, it is a-perspectival, a fourth dimension arrives as an "irruption of qualitative time into our consciousness.", and it becomes post-rational, encompassing many of the rational-structural movements along with magical origins.

Sloterdijk, in his trilogy *Spheres*, situates the human in the sphere in order to contain them and give them hope. Beginning with the bubbles "microspheric units" of the child mother relationship, moving into globes during the period encompassing the "historico-political world", and finally moving into the contemporary period of foam: "In foam worlds, the individual bubbles are not absorbed into a single, integrative hyper-orb, as in the metaphysical conception of the world, but rather drawn together to form irregular hills".

## Collapse of world views and possibilities for new ones of freedom

The internal structure of the castle is how we experience the world. Our individualised world view is defined by basic assumptions we make about the world. These are the a priori assumptions upon which the rest of our structure is built. they may be unconscious and obscured to us in which case the castle appears to be floating off the ground. they are however there and if we become aware of them we will be empowered.

Even Derrida was conscious that complete de-construction was impossible, you can't deconstruct deconstruction, and the word sign is a sign, so it cannot be argued against without using the language you are challenging.

After the collapse of classical structures such as the church, and Cartesian space time, hierarchies of order were exploded and fractured. Consciousness then begins to see what can be salvaged, what remains interconnected. There is no clear foundation so our castle of ontology may appear as floating. However, in our world removing the base doesn't destroy the structures created by previous civilizations, they remain here for us to reanimate as we see fit.

Every castle can and should be built in its own way so that it is "living".

Although metaphysical signifiers of the past have been shown to be lacking in transcendental foundations, they still hold on to many of their old connecting systems. We are not in a midden heap, but a land of floating structures, furthermore these structures can be pushed about like balloon animals, or perhaps abandoned space stations fused together to form new rafts or bazaars for disenfranchised space pirates.

This very book is written as a foundation for a castle that can be structured for freedom. If you can understand it and apply its principles to your own life, this foundation will allow for the Future Form of the Castle to develop.

# The Magician & Avatars

## The Magician

The magician is our higher self. our god self, christ self, buddha self. it is a part of us that is very close to formless pure witness. The magician is the first form that arises around an extruded witness. It is often unseen by us as it is newly evolved and only faint. It is something we need to cultivate, a true awareness of self. As opposed to false perception of self awareness, that is actually the robotic monkey self which our mind has created to automate basic function and survival.

The Magician uses the castle to gain perspective over the lands. His/her castle becomes a vessel that may journey over the ground of infinite being. With it, the magician can contemplate, engage or dance with the mind at large, which we observe from our castle, mediated by the theatre of avatars. Upon the death of what we understand as our physical body the castle is subsumed into the earth, the castle will once again become part of the ground of being and mind at large. The wizard may be drowned in this ocean as they re-enter universal consciousness. Their perspective is lost. Agency is sacrificed for communion.

The theatre of awareness resides within the castle, it is the area of which we are conscious. The rest of the castle is an unconscious background for the theatre.

The eye of the witness resides in the magician, who is often unaware of their own presence. If they are able to listen to themselves they will unlock profound wisdom. This is our genius, our higher self. This is synonymous with the genius as understood in ancient Rome, however at that time it was still thought of as a being outside of ourselves, which we experience as part of ourselves. nonetheless it is the same thing.

The magician ego is something which has a portal into the logos, that is, a network of egos that communicate directly without the need to pass through the physical world. Sometimes this sounds like our own voice and sometimes it is the voice of another.

A wizard never leaves his/her castle; they are connected to it in a symbiotic relationship. Even if a castle has been "driven" across the land right next to another castle, the wizards cannot communicate directly, as that would require emerging from the castle which is not possible until death. Instead communication between wizards is only achieved through the summoning or casting of avatars. The avatar will visit the magician at each other's castle and becomes part of their theatre to varying degrees.

When I read a book, avatars come to my castle. When I interact with you, your avatar, and the avatars that make up our conversation come to my castle.

A Magician has the ability to pull avatars out of everything in the physical universe. The power of their mind and imagination brings life to all things, all things are given a voice.

A good spell will create a strong avatar. It will be highly living and highly restructuring. Its beauty will allow it entrance to a castle and allow it to integrate. an even better spell is a collection of avatars, like a circus troupe.

**Summoning** - bring to your castle - may involve physical action but can be done purely mentally

**Casting** - send to others castles. Requires physical action to create informational energy to appear in another wizard's castle.

Castles are infectious. A living castle may enliven another.

**Monkey mind** = self generated zombie avatar. This is an avatar we have created in our own image which the light of consciousness often mistakes for the magician. In reality there may be many false conceptions of self, monkey's zombies or other forms. but for simplicity's sake we will just use the metaphor of "the monkey". When the Monkey wears the crown the castle withers. It becomes stagnant. It does however still produce avatars unconsciously and these may infect other surrounding castles. The monkey avatar self has no imagination. They do not have the ability to integrate the chaos which constantly surrounds us. And as we know if we do not integrate it both chaos and order may become pathological.

---

## Avatars

A magician interacts with the world through avatars. He can never see another magician directly nor can he see the ground of being directly (mind at large). He only sees the avatars that they create. Consciousness does not directly meet other consciousness, certainly not in a physical or mental way at any rate. And nor does our consciousness meet mind at large. When you meet someone you instead meet their image presented to you. They have "cast" their image through their presence and their action or inaction. This can be in the form of: painting, speaking, dancing, writing. Even when we are sleeping our body is generating an avatar of its image which is received by others.

This image or avatar then travels across the ground of being to your castle where it is escorted by your own avatars to meet your magician. Avatars are never solo, always multiple, always in dialogue. The avatars generated by the ground of being include space, time, and all matter. The image of the neuron firing represents the physical understanding of a thought. The image of stars and planets revolving represents the physical understanding of mind at large.

In addition to casting a wizard may also summon: When we take an action that generates a new avatar, by looking at art, reading, consuming any media, or by imagining.

It is worth investigating two types of avatars: both non verbal (thought forms) and verbal (voices).

# The Unconscious

## The unconscious

There needs perhaps to be a separate section where we talk about those aspects which are beyond comprehension and which nonetheless have entered into our castle in some way. they are unspeakable. and yet they do exist. they sit between the tonal and the ground of being. they are intuition and a vast wisdom that we cannot comprehend, they are without many of the limiting valves that sit closer to our conception of self, time and world. and thus they may hold extreme power and truth, as they are close to the sea of pure beautiful chaos. to the face of god.

These unconscious forces enter only the very outskirts of the castle, they have not yet collapsed to a particle state.

In Nietzsche, there is no universal truth. The truthfulness of truth is at once a lie. Untruth, Nietzsche tells us, is "a condition of life". Everything for Nietzsche, including the reception of his work, is a mask. "Every philosophy", he writes, "also conceals a philosophy; every opinion is also a hiding-place, every word also a mask".

The map is not the territory. All structures are fundamentally maya. However we do gain something to re-gift back to the ground of being by extruding.

There is no fundamental right way to structure the interior of the castle as there is an inevitable collapse of the wave function to make it function.

Masks are another name for an avatar. And when we reach out to the unconscious we are confronted with powerful forces and beings which have not collapsed into graspable particle yet.

> "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern"

## Thought Forms

There is an image world that is structured very differently than our currently accepted logical language. It is the world of thought forms. It can be found at night before bed, as one closes one's eyes, through the use of hallucinogens or in dreams.

It presents us with a non logic: akin to Castaneda's accounts in his books on the teachings of Don Juan, there are two forms of reality, the tonal and the nagual. "In order to talk about it we must borrow from the island of the tonal, therefore it is more convenient not to explain it but to simply recount its effects."

There is an occult tradition of seeing thought forms often emanating from auras. Annie Besant in her book with C.W. Leadbeater *Thought Forms* (1901) depicts thought forms as real things that can be created intentionally or unintentionally by an entity, and then could be observed by another with the correct "sight". She divided thought forms into three types: the shape of the person that creates them, all other shapes recognised as a visualisation of a physical world object, and finally abstract forms representing astral or mental planes.

---

## The Logos

There is a consciousness that accompanies thought forms, this can also come in the form of voices. McKenna calls it Logos: the voice in the head that people had in the Greco roman world – what people were striving for, that told you how to live and gave you answers. For example Socrates had a daemon that was his crap detector, an invisible agency speaking from hyperspace.

Mckenna's own visions often involve "self-transforming machine elves", "There are forces friendly to our struggle to birth ourselves as an intelligent species". "Right here and now, one quanta away, there is raging a universe of active intelligence that is transhuman, hyperdimensional, and extremely alien."

# Shared Avatars & Chaos vs Order

## Shared Avatars

There is a social dynamic that arises between castles as they share their avatars.

Certain avatars may get stronger as they are reinforced and become dominant in reshaping a group's castles. An Ideology is a particular group of avatars that is self-strengthening, this creates a symbiotic relationship that usually allows for the castle construction to be mostly automated. Some examples are Catholicism, Communism, Consumerism, all cults, and all movements. Some of these "cults" are profoundly positively transformative. They usually help a person to shed one reality tunnel and reinstate a new one.

Leaders of movements generally are trying to help people become better. Some allow for more movement of development and some are more controlling. For an organisation to grow and thus help more people there needs to be a strong cathedral. This allows for easier transformations, people can easily drop into a new reality tunnel.

These movements can be seriously transformational. Radically re-shifting the castles of multiple people out of the (usually consumer) paradigm they are stuck in. Social cathedrals allow for power from the castles to flow into the cathedral. The teacher that is providing the transformitory cathedral receives power as the creator of the cathedral. And often the power can go to their heads, especially as it is the exercising of power that continues to build the cathedral.

If you wish to be saved from slavery you will have to annihilate what "must be annihilated". To become the Child again, the creative yes being. William Blake shows us the way:

> "Obey thou the Words of the Inspired Man
> All that can be annihilated must be annihilated
> That the Children of Jerusalem may be saved from slavery"

---

## Chaos vs order

Castles are structured to contain the chaos that they encounter.

Castles wish to continue growing and building themselves. We can further define that the order of the castle may be dynamic quality orientated or quantity orientated. Quantity orientated can become tyrannical in its self-replication, whereas quality orientated is creative and more open to restructuring. Quantity increases the reach of possible actions and quality increases the set of known actions.

|  | **Quantity** (increases Possibilities) |  |
|---|---|---|
|  | **Dis-ordered** | **Ordered** |
| **Quality** (Increases known actions) | **Un-chaotic** | Zombie | Tyrant |
|  | **Chaotic** | Punk | Creative |

Punk and zombie configurations present no challenge to the tyrant and the creative. It is the Tyrant and the creative structure that is in an endless battle. They are the two great forces that reach for freedom: Creative order and pathological order.

This is a dynamic within each of us but it also plays out in ideology and social dynamics. There is a pendulum that swings between the two over history.

Alexander the great conquered half the world as did the Persian Empire before him, the bloody and power hungry nations unified many countries. Eventually leading to great growth in the sharing of knowledge as seen in the library of Alexandria. Tyrannical order gave way to a creative one.

Existence appears to have a self-righting mechanism. However, many front-on attempts to confront tyranny (or pathological order) in the pursuit of freedom only result in another tyranny.

These examples of science fiction are indicative of an eternal struggle between pathological and creative freedom. The protagonists and to a greater extent the authors live in a way that is "excellent", increasing freedom and the expansion of consciousness through imagination. The more links they or we can integrate, the further one can expand, in a sea of consciousness that is without bounds, breaking out of any reality tunnel or matrix that is restricting one.

If existence is pure consciousness, with stories embedded in myths embedded in stories, then life becomes a kind of game. The universe and imagination spontaneously erupt infinitely, let's embrace this life with joy: "party on dudes"

# Navigation - Chaos vs Order

## Growing and Dying: The Creative vs The Tyrant

Castles are structured to contain the chaos that they encounter.

Castles wish to continue growing and building themselves. We can further define that the order of the castle may be **dynamic quality orientated** or **quantity orientated**. Quantity orientated can become tyrannical in its self-replication, whereas quality orientated is creative and more open to restructuring.

This is a dynamic within each of us but it also plays out in ideology and social dynamics. There is a pendulum that swings between the two over history.

## Navigation Through Chaos and Order

Castles of individual freedom = **structuring**
Navigating the ground of being = **navigation**

We have already touched on the primacy of the imagination. If imagination is the basis of reality then anything we can think is real. So then how do we navigate it? Given the apparent lack of transcendental signifieds, can we say that true and false exist?

### The Deepest Foundation

The Deepest foundation sits outside of time and space. It is a gravitational anchor of love and beauty for the castle. It is the embodiment of Christ; it is the overman as the meaning of the earth. It will be our map, a picture of the path of initiation, and the philosophers' stone. Once we become aware of the forces that give our castle structure we can amplify them and increase the dynamic growth of our castle.

We begin as a child. And the child calls us to join them in the future. **To know is to love.** The expansion of consciousness is an act of love. A baby/child is full of this love, they send out all their impulses and see what they receive.

---

# Navigation - Active Imagination Methods

## The Bridge Between Mind at Large and Individual Self

In the end, the best form of navigation is to accept that anything can be real to the extent that it develops its unified complexity, and we can develop any imaginary idea or avatar through visionary imagination.

**Active Imagination** is a technique we may use as the wizard to summon avatars into the castle, to make them living, and to integrate them into the structure of the castle. Jung coined the term Active imagination, which defines itself in opposition to passive imagination, such as dreams or simply daytime reveries of various sorts. Being active means participating in the imaginative realm. Thus forming a link between the conscious and the subconscious mind.

## Understanding the Unconscious

It is worth noting that the term **unconscious** is misleading. Jung believed that our dream life always exists in every moment, however the part of us that is self-reflective is not always in communication with this part of ourselves.

## Expanding Beyond the Small Self

Our fairly narrow and perhaps fragile self-image that locates ourselves as an individual, and allows us the necessities of clock time and bodily boundary only occupies a tiny epicenter of our possible larger self. If we can move outwards we can meet the alters that live with us in the metabolism of our body.

## The First Step: Accepting Imagination as Real

The first step of active imagination is to **accept imagination as real**, at least as much as the exterior world is real. If we can do this, we allow ourselves the impetus to be active participants in the world of the imagination, which beckons to us when given the status of ontological primitive.

Our everyday existence is mostly made up of a chattering monkey mind, which we can visualize as ourselves in a large castle shining a bright torch on a manikin that stands before us. This manikin is the **false self**. It is a zombie avatar that we sleepily accept as our real self. We are shining this torch so brightly at the zombie avatar that our eyes are blinded to the large hall around us.

---

## Method 1: Move Away From Your Small Self

We need to destroy the zombie avatar. We may need to **occupy**, **annihilate**, or **subdue** our small self, through repetitive activity, pushing ourselves to our limits and meditation respectively.

### Occupy
Occupy through tasks such as:
- Dancing
- Writing
- Painting

### Annihilate
Annihilate through:
- Breath work
- Various forms of visionquest
- Psychedelics

### Subdue
Subdue through meditation.

---

## Method 2: Look Into Infinite Being

This is the other side of the coin from the last step, so it happens simultaneously.

**Salvador Dali** had several methods of entering a hypnagogic state in which he could look into infinite being:
- He recommends planting olive trees around the house so that the leaves may create a soup of flickering, which may seduce your eyes in vision into reverie
- He also recommended spending hours with a blank white canvas at dusk

**Leonardo Da Vinci** similarly recommended looking into splashes of mud in order that visions might be generated: "By indistinct things the mind is stimulated to new inventions"

Fundamentally we need to open our awareness to the subconscious. **"Learn to see or hear the dream while awake"**

---

## Method 3: Curiosity - Begin the Dialogue

The next step is to begin a dialogue. Would you like to speak first? You can, however a dialogue can start from any side.

### The Old Man of the Sea

Let's say you happen to shine your light on the old man of the sea, who is probably loitering somewhere in the room. The problem is as soon as you shine your light on him he will shift:

> "into a bearded lion and then into a snake and after that a panther and a giant boar. He changed into running water too and a great tree with many leaves."

However you must always remember that he is the old man of the sea and keep your light on him. The unconscious or infinite being has made the first move in the dialogue by revealing to you the old man.

If you are to keep the dialogue going which is the purpose of active imagination (and the purpose of life) you need to **ask a question**.

---

## Method 4: Embody (Navigation and Structuring)

Another method of holding on to forms produced by infinite consciousness is through creating things.

> "the picture must be protected from sinking back into the unconscious, be it by drawing, painting or writing down what one has heard or seen."

Something about trying to record our vision will often help to discover it further. In a Heideggerian world disclosure that brings the vision or avatar into a physical space, and starts the process of **embodiment**.

---

## Method 5: Love (Navigation)

A danger of active imagination is falling into the abyss.

> "The method is not entirely without danger, because it may carry the patient too far away from reality"

We may lose touch with the outside world or become trapped in a malevolent loop. There is a single fix for both these problems: **Love**.

**Love for beings in the finite world keeps us in touch**, and **love for beings in the infinite world transforms malevolence**, revealing and connecting us with truth, and eventually consuming the once malevolent being into the higher self.

**Love every being you find.** Love all beings that you experience. Especially the ones you are repelled or scared by. Love conquers all, and allows shadows to integrate rather than fracture and become 'radicalized'. Everything has something to reveal to you and to add to your castle.

---

## Method 6: Beauty (Structuring or Navigating Structure)

### Beauty = Unified Chaos

McKenna makes the point that we can no longer point to what is true anymore, nor what is good/moral. But he believes we still know what is beautiful, and that we can use **beauty as a gauge to evaluate truth**. So if an idea is beautiful it is probably true.

Beauty in this sense is probably closer to a Kantian notion, an aesthetic experience capable of generating criticality, rather than beauty as prettiness. Beauty will be a forever-unachievable goal that our castle will constantly gravitate towards.

### Living Ideas

A beautiful idea is one that is **living**; it has the ability to speak to the soul and to enliven the castle. We will see that they are beautiful and flowering. **We shall know them by their fruits!**

---

## Method 7: Detachment (Navigation)

After radical love we must add **radical detachment**. We must regard all of experience both inward and outward as a myth. This gives us a profound grasp on the true nature of reality.

**"Emptiness"** is the magic word that names the essence of the universe. If we understand that every reality is a myth, then we have greater power.

---

# Navigation - Case Studies

## Julie Heffernan

Julie Heffernan is a contemporary practitioner of active imagination. She doesn't directly use the phrase active imagination, but she does talk of her discovery and subsequent use of image streaming. Her image streaming forms one side of an active imagination dialogue that makes up her practice.

She describes first discovering the technique in a hypnagogic state following a long day of painting:

> "I was painting for twelve hours a day….exhausted, I shut my eyes and went into a relaxed state. Suddenly I started to see pictures pouring into my head."

Her method is to continue the dialogue between the created image and her inner image stream. "It's really fun to paint this way. A lot of people start with a drawing but I think it kills the process. Each character walks on into my conscious mind" giving the character the stream into her agency allows them to come to life, and thus she is able to begin a dialogue with them.

Heffernan is very aware that she wants to also construct the painting spatially. She has a discipline that is able to hold her visions. She is a successful surrealist, and that is not a title that can be applied often. The reality of the imagination is complete in itself. We should not interpret it with any theory. Take the reality of the Imaginal realm as it is, and question the various forces so that they may respond.

Dreams exist in a different realm of logic. if we can enter into this logic, and accept it as real. Further truths may unfold to us. To use active imagination we have to accept unconscious dreams as just as real as the outer world.

---

## Alchemy (Example of Active Imagination)

At the outset we can say that nothing is off limits to the imagination. It is completely up to the individual where they would focus their beam of attention as whichever part we perceive, we see an image of the whole.

One of the lenses for the development of the castle is Alchemy, a practice of participation between matter and thought. Which is intimately linked to Gnosticism, Shamanism, Witchcraft, Magic, and other Occult practices.

We can look for parallels in the work of Goethean science as developed by Steiner, to shine a light on what this tradition might look like.

Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy roughly translates to Knowledge of the nature of man. Anthroposophy's scope encompasses all existence, and so we see that it is the study of the human in all things.

Goethe and following him Steiner are making a step towards a re-unifying Final participation. People today seek an 'objective' understanding of Nature through research that is completely separated from the human being. Goethe wanted a living interaction with nature, the task of the scientist was to enter into the living essence of the plant and discover its "Ur-phenomena" its underlying archetypal pattern.

---

## Simultaneous Contrast (Example of Active Imagination)

> "The opposite of a fact is falsehood, but the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth." — Niels Bohr

Simultaneous contrast would have to be a gravitator for the castle, a truth is never content to be left standing on its own with no opposition to keep it healthy.

The best thought images are often created through a juxtaposition of incongruences. A deep symbol is a thought form. A thought form is often a hallucinogenic structure that is visual, we cannot read it per se, we rather know from it, it speaks to us but not as a voice.

Terrence McKenna identifies strongly with Alchemy. He talks about its characteristics as alchemical/mercury thought and the union of opposites, the search for the philosopher's stone. "Alchemical thinking is thinking that is always antithetical", it forms a union of opposites.

---

# Immortality

## Transforming the Castle Beyond Death

It is possible that we restructure our castle so that it cannot die, so that our ego may continue to live until we are satisfied with our embodiment of infinite being. This is the logical potential of potentiation. We have to create a castle that will not be torn apart by the forces of darkness at death; by the infinite being that is our mother.

The rejection of complete dissolution into infinite being is a negation; we are saying no to something. The Kabbalists see negativity as "the essential manifestation of the primal will". The name for primal will is Keter, it is a "darkness which is at the same time the source of all light." Keter's negativity gives light and existence to all the other sefirot and at the same time it is "delight and desire". It is a primal delight and desire that is at the heart of creation. For the yes of creation to come into being it has to say no.

## Preparing the Castle for Death

Using the Tibetan book of the dead and consciousness building exercises it is possible that a wizard may be able to "live" beyond the death of the physical body and maintain some perspective. The Magician must prepare the castle for submersion if it is his/her wish to maintain their agency.

## Integrating the Opposites

The next important step is to embrace the other. We have to integrate the masculine and the feminine. In other words we must have a strong enough order to hold chaos inside ourselves. Otherwise we will be overwhelmed by exterior chaos.

Milton paints a scene where the multiplistic feminine principle is first exploded out from ourselves in a diversifying force before being reintegrated with our conscious self. As a "Garment dipped in blood" around the limbs of Jesus. The imagination around the ego.

## Annihilating the Negation

> "Obey thou the Words of the Inspired Man
> All that can be annihilated must be annihilated
> That the Children of Jerusalem may be saved from slavery"

If you wish to be saved from slavery you will have to annihilate what "must be annihilated". To become the Child again, the creative yes being.

## The Body Transformation Process

To live fully is to accept embodiment in its profuse expanse. The garment of blood that must be worn. This is not about escaping the body but about transforming it—transforming the physical, etheric, and astral bodies so that they serve the Magician rather than bind it.

When we transform our lower bodies with consciousness, we begin to control our own reincarnation. We become capable of carrying our flowering ego through death and rebirth, maintaining continuity of consciousness. This is the true meaning of immortality.

## Immortality as Creative Affirmation

The path to immortality is not one of denial or escape, but of radical affirmation. It is saying YES to embodiment, YES to differentiation, YES to the creative unfolding of consciousness through matter.

You may read this and question our sanity, but we assure you we have clear eyes. We know we cannot fly..... but a time is coming soon when we can.

---

# Apocalypse

## The Call of the Final Destination

The apocalypse is a force that comes towards us from the future. It is a retroactive force that ripples out from an unknown event of becoming. The event is the full realisation of potential; the idealised castle structure. The event is obfuscated but its effects are visible and felt as a tidal wave.

It is something that calls to us from the future much like aliens. It is a time paradox. As the hyperspheric castle inflows and outflows, tidal waves pass it, one after the other over eons. This is a force from the future that is acting on our castle in the present.

---

## Tidal Wave

> "We can find all the teachings of Theosophy in the Apocalypse" — Steiner

### The Apocalypse as Imagination

The apocalypse presents us with a series of images. And it is through eating these images and transforming our astral body that we can transform our etheric and physical bodies.

The imagination is a tool of the knowledge seeker. According to Steiner, the images that can be received are not arbitrary. Steiner places imagination as a stepping block to intuition and inspiration.

### Cyclical Time

The apocalypse can almost be seen as a comforting device, placing time within a structure, in a perhaps more graspable paradigm than a continuous infinity. Perhaps this is why it is a recurring symbol in so many cultures. 2012 was regarded as the end date of the 5126 year long Mayan Calendar, and Terrance McKenna joined in on this prediction via his Time wave theory of increasing novelty.

### Steiner's Reading of Revelation

Rudolf Steiner gives us a reading of St. John's Revelation, in his lecture series *Reading the Pictures of the Apocalypse*, as an image of the future of evolution. As well as it being a text of initiation, giving us an image of the structure of the human, as it is and can be.

> "We should allow the holy symbols given in the Apocalypse to work upon us. The sign of the Sun intelligence, for example, should not remain a mere sign for us; we should immerse ourselves in this sign until we feel it is no longer dead but flowing with life."

---

## Solar Flare

### Sun Gazing and the Cross

I felt the tidal wave today, as I was outside weeing on the lemon tree, I closed my eyelids and looked towards the sun. Visions and patterns played across my vision and I knew I was being called through time.

The electromagnetic solar wind reaches out to all beings in the solar system and guides them, like a massive brain sending pulses through its neurons.

An image of the cross is present in many pre-Christian cultures. This is perhaps part of the reason Steiner equates the sun with Christ. Christ comes to us as an embodiment of the sun, to bring love to the earth, and so transform it giving it freedom and ego.

### The Sun as Love

The solar wind is the voice of Eros calling us towards the future, the transcendent object, pulling us to ever greater hallucination.

The Greeks felt the sun pervading them inwardly; "[They] felt the sun as that which infused Love into the living organism, guiding Eros through the waves of sentient existence."

---

## Black Hole

> "We are being sucked into the body of eternity" — Terrence McKenna

### The Sun as Black Hole

As we have seen the sun has some similarities to a black hole: "The Sun [is] a hollow space of suction which annihilates everything within it…. Anything brought to it is immediately absorbed and disappears."

### Time Wave Theory

McKenna's Timewave theory uses the I-Ching to produce an algorithm. McKenna argues that the history of the universe has been one of ever increasing complexity, it in fact is accelerating, and so, much like the theory of the singularity, McKenna also placed the end of history, and the apocalypse or in his words the transcendental object at the end of time, in the year 2012.

### Post-2012: Inside the Event Horizon

This theory is interesting to me particularly because we are now in the year 2025. If the year 2012 represents an event horizon, then after we pass through it we will see everything that has already passed into it, all of the past back to the beginning of time will be presented to us as a simultaneous present.

---

## Sonic Boom

### The Accumulation of History

If we look at our place in time and the evolution of consciousness, we find ourselves moving into post-history and post-rational consciousness. We find ourselves moving towards a final participation, and into magic, in an increasing hallucination of connective technology. As we pass into the realm of post-history we find that the interconnections of Magic/alchemy/Shamanism are infinitely more complex, as it now contains the accumulative sonic boom of history.

### Growing Like Trees

> "keep growing, keep changing, we shed our old bark, we shed our skins every spring, we keep becoming younger, fuller of future, taller, stronger, we push our roots ever more powerfully into the depths - into evil - while at the same time we embrace the heavens ever more lovingly, more broadly, imbibing their light ever more thirstily with all our twigs and leaves."

---

## Living After the Apocalypse

> "We should live as if the apocalypse has already occurred and will happen again." — Terrence McKenna

We are already living in post-apocalyptic times. The event horizon has been crossed. The tidal wave surrounds us. The solar flare illuminates us. We fall through the black hole.

The question is not "when will the apocalypse come?" but rather "how do we navigate the apocalypse we are already within?"

The apocalypse is not an ending but a revealing. The word itself means "unveiling" or "revelation." What is being revealed is the true nature of reality—that consciousness is primary, that we are builders of castles, that we are falling through infinite dimensions toward an incomprehensible attractor.

I would like to do my part to increase the speed at which we head towards the singularity of complexity. As I would say it is the evolution of consciousness and the flowering of love. To love is to know. So the intent is talismanic integral art, of unified complexity.

---

# Real-World Outcomes

> "We should live as if the apocalypse has already occurred and will happen again." — Terrence McKenna

How should we expand our castle, and the society of all castles, to its full potential? so that we may question Infinite Being, become living, really incarnate fully, and become a creator, a magician? We will need both chaos and order in order that we may facilitate the next apocalypse, the next evolution of consciousness.

I also would like to do my part to increase the speed at which we head towards the singularity of complexity. As I would say it is the evolution of consciousness and the flowering of love. To love is to know. So the intent is talismanic integral art, of unified complexity.

---

## ART

### Enkiverse (a manifesto)

**ENKIVERSE** takes its name from Enki, a forerunner of Prometheus, who gave humanity the keys to elevate ourselves to the position of gods.

**Enki-Verse = A song of the universe which unlocks, unfurls and blossoms mind.**

The Enkiverse is an ever expanding psycho-spatial artworld mythology encompassing the artistic practice of Zed.

> The fine art of painting, which is the bastard of alchemy, always has been and always will be, a game. The rules of the game are quite simple: in a given arena, on as many psychic fronts as the talent allows, one must visually describe, the center of the meaning of existence. — Brett Whiteley

If we had to choose a term to describe Enkiverse it would be Visionary. This term has the attitude of expanding reality beyond the material realm. It is in effect bringing mind into matter. It contains fields such as sci-fi and eroticism within it. Also the psychic landscape which contains romanticism. All of this is embodied.

---

### Visionary art

Visionary art usually defines a relatively narrow period beginning with Ernst Fuchs and flourishing into the psychedelic revolution. It often overlaps with psychedelic art. Most art in any area is drab, and stereotypical, and psychedelic and visionary art are no different. However if we are to use these terms correctly, visionary and psychedelic by definition would be highly original. They look beyond what is known and expand the psyche.

---

### Sci-fi

The Science fiction genre allows for the greatest expansion of consciousness. The greatest possibility to create links. It allows complete freedom to draw on any source, embracing fantasy, the "real" world, the distant future, mythology, aliens, magic, time travel, spirituality etc.

---

## Eroticism / Orgasmysticism

There is a thread of eroticism that runs through visionary artists from Blake, to Dali, to Ernst Fuchs. Drawing on Freud and Jung there is a sexual force that motivates everything. And this sexual force exists in the collective unconscious.

Erotic energy is the first mover of the kabbalah. Keter can be regarded as a primary source of psychic energy or volition. So in this view erotic energy is the most basic force. The erotic goes hand in hand with the visionary as artists tap into the ground of being. Eros is the first god in Parmenides' ancient Greek cosmology that impels evolution. Eroticism is the fabric at the centre of being.

This erotic force is everywhere in some ways it is also the life force.

Eroticism is the greatest force of materialisation, of embodiment. It contains the guts and the skin. It is the garment of blood that must be worn to embrace experience in its profuse expanse.

---

### A note on objectification

It would be prudent at this point to respond to the complaint of the objectification of women. Art objectifies and subjectifies everything. Artifice is the materialisation or embodiment of something, it is necessarily objectifying by definition.

It is of utmost importance that male artists are able to depict women. They explore how their own sexual urges may be unified into the broader architecture of art. Furthermore we must find healthy evolutions of the erotic/artistic depiction of women.

---

### Romanticism

Romanticism is all about reclaiming the body of emotion. Arising first out of the industrial revolution as we were undergoing a materialist spiritual split. Romanticism is needed once again to seduce the viewer into an experience of chaos that is outside their consumer ideology.

---

## COMMUNITY

### Freedom is a choice

We can be grateful that we are born in an age when the default stance is to do what you are told and to not step outside of the centralised treadmill that has been laid out for us. Freedom of thought and action is not a default right that is given to us. Instead it must be taken. We must consciously reach out and flip the switch. And decide we want to be free.

---

## JOURNEY

### Increasing the bandwidth of life

We exist in a space between two extremes. The height and the depth. We can imagine ourselves travelling horizontally through time, we are existing in a band that can vary in width. Many people live a bland life, their band is narrow. There is a gravitational pull that always brings some of the band towards the middle line, so if you have a narrow band it will never reach far into the heights or depths. Whereas if you have a wide band you can reach up further into the heights or depths whilst fulfilling the needs of the gravity of the middle line.

---

### Mental Inversion swings

If you are trying to envision a forest valley front on you may find it hard. You must come at it with your peripheral vision. To do so don't push forwards all the time but invert your desire. Invert the forest valley so that everything air is now solid and everything solid is now air. Now invert your vision back again and you will find you have made progress.

---

### Physical Inversion Swings

Or, How you can prepare your physical and emotional body so that conceptually and spiritually you can go further and deeper and keep grounded.

Rembrandt is the master of light by virtue of his overwhelming darkness.

Many of the physical inversion swings will increase your capacity for life. Such as deep sleeping/working out, light dark swings, fasting and feeding, breathing swings, sun gazing, heat and cold, exercise.
