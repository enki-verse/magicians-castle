# The Castle

## The Castle

The structure of experience is a castle, a spatial construction of consciousness extruded from mind at large. Mind at large is both mind and physical, a single substance like a Möbius strip that appears to have two sides but is truly one. However extrusions, or castles, join witness and physical without using a Mobius strip, instead forming a structured chain of being. Over time, castles have evolved, growing in complexity from plants to animals to humans. Within an individual's lifetime, the castle's structure can shift as our understanding of the world transforms.

Our extrusions contain many qualities in common with other extrusions, especially with our fellow human extrusions. Any metabolising being is extruded, but humans are more structured and potent.

the castle localises mind at large, building a bridge between the local witness and physical reality. For humans we form a higher self around our witness, and around that we form a world conception along with a lower self or a monkey self. This then acts upon a further link that is an energetic medium, or a powerful zone of unconsciousness, before it reaches physical reality as we know it.

Within this structure in humans, there is vast room for customisation. the higher self or ego may be barely there or very strong. the lower self can be in service of the higher self, or it can be a zombie tyrant. There is variance in our emotional understanding of the world, our experience of time and space, variance in life force, our pattern recognition, and so on. but out of all these our world conception varies the most widely.

The world conception is visualised as a grand theatre inside the castle. The structure of the theatre is often changing. There are so many ways for the world to be understood. Whole worlds may exist within this theatre which is vast and cavernous. someone living in a highly animistic or deeply mythological framework that predates organized religion or abstract philosophy will construct a theatre where nature is alive and full of spirits. someone deeply embedded in hyper-rationalism or scientism, where materialism defines reality, and spirituality is dismissed, will have a very different stage, one that is perhaps more representative of modern culture. Finally someone that blends technological and spiritual paradigms, embracing integration through futuristic or transhumanist lenses and spotlights will have another stage construction built, for their own purpose, to find the patterns they are looking for.

The Infinite consciousness of the ground of being contains all the answers but it lacks the ability to see itself, and it also lacks the ability to ask questions. We perceive the ground of being as the physical universe. Our castle is temporarily catalysed and extricated out of the universal net, gaining perspective and partially losing our connectedness. The higher from the earth we grow the more perspective we have, but the harder it is for us to connect to our rhizomatic and mycelial roots, this is what we must do however, and we must do it in two ways, by feeling down into our depths, and by watching from our position of perspective the infinite mycelial net that surrounds us. We must do both at once otherwise we will move into the pre-rational Dionysian or the rational Apollonian. We must be like the centaur; its lower body is its connection to dream, its head and hands pointing at the target.

## The Theatre

### Hyperspheric shadow

*(Mind at large is hyperspheric, extrusions collapse the quantum wave function to a particle. the interior of mind space must be made 3d so that we may actually navigate it. so here we discuss the problems of visualising hyperspheric reality and after maybe we should talk about kabbalah?)*

Hyperspheric thinking extends within experience to all the layers of reality we experience: the universe, galaxy, solar system, Earth, and the Human Body.

History is a series of black holes holding other black holes, universes in universes. The present is another universe, birthed by all previous eras, the latest baby babushka doll. And simultaneously, evolution envelops the past retroactively. Our reptilian brain is enveloped by our mammalian brain, which is enveloped by our neocortex; archaic consciousness is enveloped by mythic consciousness, which is enveloped by rational consciousness, which is enveloped by a post-rational consciousness. Past and future forms of consciousness can be seen as simultaneous interiors and exteriors. So we are in a hyperspheric universe, and to visualise and understand the structure of experience, we see dynamic hyperspheric allegories.

Let us try and understand the hypersphere: As we move through the dimensions from a 0D point, to a 1D line (with 2 points), to a 2D square (with 4 points), and a 3D cube (with 8 points), we reach another theoretical dimension, the 4D, and its object along this progression, the hyper cube (with 16 points). Just as each previous dimension added has doubled the existing points and structure, so too does the 4th dimension; the cube stretches out into the fourth dimension. See illustration of hypercube. The hypercube is visualised in 3d space as a cube that engulfs another cube but that is simultaneously engulfed by that cube. This 3d visualisation can be further understood by animation, just like a torus or hair scrunchy can revolve so that the outside becomes the inside, so can a hypercube, except that with a hyper cube there isn't negative and positive space, it's all positive, so imagine the negative space of a scrunchy also being filled in. one negative space each in the middle, top and bottom of the scrunchy, and one on the left, right, forward and back. We can see there exists 7 cubes within a hyper cube, and each one could be folded into the centre of the 3d visualisation of the hypercube space.

For an animation of the hypercube projection see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtSNStVW81M

A hyperspace is a good way to visualise our castle, as our cube of reference can shift, and each enfolder can become brought into focus and visualised by the witness in its time.

The history of the universe can be seen as a generation of further enfoldings through time. Atoms exist first and soon generate molecules, which enfold them, and then single cell organisms which enfold atoms, then neuronal organisms, neural cord organisms, the reptilian brain stem, the limbic system, and the neo cortex enfolds all of these previous levels.

These states of evolution also correspond to the evolution of consciousness locomotive=neural cord, archaic= neo cortex, magic = complex neo cortex, and then we get to further states of consciousness, and each state encompasses the last: Magic, mythic, rational, and Centauric. Or socially: village, empire, nation, and planetary. You get the picture… maybe. Anyway the main thing to grasp is how the next level must encompass the last.

At the same time we find ourselves unfolding in the other direction. We find our complex systems of life in the biosphere of the earth, in the solar system, in the galaxy, in the universe, which is perhaps one in a multiverse pea and ham soup type situation. So this complexity finds itself on the inside, as opposed to the outside that the neocortex finds itself on.

If we move to the human experience of the present, we may see that time enfolds in both directions: The now surrounds all previous time while at once being surrounded by all previous time. We are shaped by time, but we also retroactively change time by our decisions, actions, and perhaps most importantly our creations (see retroactive force, in the Tidal wave chapter)

Rudolf Steiner introduced an idea of Counterspace that I believe describes the six enfolding cubes of the central cube in the hypercube. Counterspace can be seen as the mirror image of Euclidean space. Instead of the plane at infinity, the point is at infinity. Everywhere is the centre. An example of this is his picture of the head torso and limbs of the human being. Steiner takes Goethe's theories of morphology as a casting off point. Noting Goethe's experience of finding a lamb's skull in a field and on observation coming to conclusion that the forms of the skull can be seen as morphed vertebrae. Steiner takes the image of a morphed skull into the limbs of the human, and asks us to imagine a sock being turned inside out, thus the limb bone is an inverted skull. The skull is a complete image of itself, forming a complete sphere; the torso is only a partial physicalisation of its true soul sphere form, but once we reach the limbs the bones have been turned inside out, and the entire universe is the sphere, the limbs are a tiny slither of a physicalized plane that forms the circumference of a sphere that's origin is located everywhere/in infinity. Steiner has given us another example of Counterspace, and we may also draw from this human image one of the Castle. Because the castle describes all levels of our reality: the universe, galaxy, solar system, Earth, and the Human Body.

This image of the human places the head as purely body, the torso as body and soul, and the limbs as body soul and spirit. This is yet another example of a simultaneous reversal of structure, instead of the traditional understanding of the head being our most evolved/perfected aspect.

## Evolving world conceptions (customisable)

There is a clear ontological progression that takes place with individuals and civilisations. We begin with a single foundation stone; this lifts us out of the unified ground of being. The stone also acts as our sense organ, which at this early stage is one dimensional and minimal bandwidth. A baby sends out impulses and sees what they receive. Out of a chaotic soup of sense perceptions rhythms begin to emerge. Allowing the child to begin to differentiate. Differentiation allows categorisation and navigation. Space and primitive time are unlocked. We extend our limbs into the world and open new sense organs. Our castle becomes a basic home with doors and windows and a roof. It has successfully lifted the magician out of the soup of infinite being. For example we might have a simple teepee for our castle, with a gravitational pull of love that holds everything down. While a tensile strength of pragmatic enquiry stops the castle from collapsing. The magician may now receive and summon avatars to further aid in the construction of the castle.

[Diagram would go here]

When it is healthy the castle is in a constant state of restructuring. Avatars integrate with the structure around them as they enter the castle.

As the castle grows and integrates further dimensions or paradigms it becomes harder to visualise. It moves beyond the 3 dimensional into the hyperspheric.

As the castle grows it transforms, evolving through various structures. As the castle evolves it swings back and forth between chaos and order. New chaos is continually integrated into the body of the castle, i.e. order. The castle moves from pre-rational, to rational, to post-rational, to neo-rational.

| Pre-rational | rational | Post-rational | Neo-rational |
|--------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| disassociated chaos | structured | dislocated clusters of structure/paradigms | integrated multi paradigm structure |
| (antithesis) | thesis (synthesis) | antithesis | synthesis (thesis) |

Out of a magical shamanic past humankind went through a period of Euclidean hierarchy building in religion and science, after which post-structuralist and post-modern thought popped the bubbles; exploding the structures of the past into a midden heap of diverse paradigms with no apparent hierarchical depth. There have been various attempts to re-integrate these paradigms into a hypersphere, which is an intermediary structure on our path back to graspability and embodiment. Multiple dimensions of the hypersphere are finally relocated back into Euclidean space; the final structure is the kabbalistic tree, wherein the previous chaos can be metabolised into something navigable to a perceiving alter.

The castle begins in the most basic form as a pile, a simple form of consciousness, of action and reaction, pleasure and pain. At the second stage the castle becomes rationalised and we learn to delineate. Consciousness becomes more complex as it integrates other paradigms; a process of allowing a chaotic element from the outside of the castle to be integrated and held by its ordering structure. This can continue for a long time, in a human life for much of childhood, until we come across a paradigm that we have not allowed room for in our structure, and if the body of the castle has become calcified it may fracture at this point. This might happen when we come across relativity, or quantum mechanics, or the singularity of the big bang. It might happen if we question the paradigm we are using to build the rest of our structure upon. Say if we question our religion, or the validity of space-time.

[Diagram would go here]

At this point our structures may become disassembled. We are left with a midden heap of transcendental signifieds. Upon which ordering structures begin to rebuild whether we are conscious of it or not. And if we don't have a plan we will become part of someone else's plan. We may fall victim to an organising structure that is dictated to us by our consumer society, in which case we will eventually be consumed by the cathedral (chronos, the consuming mother). Or we can begin down a path of awakening and unification which leads first to the hypersphere and then to the Kabbalistic tree of life.

## stages of consciousness

Thought-space is the picture provided when we construct consciousness spatially. Many types of consciousness are visualised in different ways, resulting in different thought spaces.

This is an alchemical or hallucinogenic way of looking at thought, in that it is associative and morphic. Several theorists have developed the thought space concept: Jean Gebser, Ken Wilber, Peter Sloterdijk, John David Ebert, Deleuze and Guattari all generate spatial images of an evolving consciousness. The psychogeographers and Will Self demonstrate a further step of using the spatial nature of the physical world to change the way we think, and vice versa, the way we think restructuring the physical world.

Jean Gebser's dimensions of consciousness are dimensional: **Archaic structure** is 0 dimensional, it is the first structure to emerge from "the ever-present origin", "The human being was totally immersed in the world unable to extricate himself or herself from that world". They were identical with that world. **Magic structure** is 1 dimensional, humans have a sense of being separate from the world around them but are not yet in their ego, language emerges as word magic so that objects and people are magically related. **Mythic structure** is 2 dimensional, we are now conscious of the other, it is a consciousness of polarities, memory and feeling interact and create religion. **Mental/Rational structure** is 3 dimensional, here we have the Hegelian trinity of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The rational epoch "required centuries to sufficiently devitalize and demythologize the word so that it was able to express distinct concepts freed from the wealth of imagery, as well as to reach the rationalistic extreme where the word, once a power [magic] and later an image [myth], was degraded to a mere formula." An attribute of rational consciousness, being 3d, is that it is now perspectival. **Integral structure** is 4 dimensional, it is a-perspectival, a fourth dimension arrives as an "irruption of qualitative time into our consciousness.", and it becomes post-rational, encompassing many of the rational-structural movements along with magical origins. For further reading Ken Wilber draws on Gebser as well as Aurobindo, Piaget and Fowler to develop a more complex layering of the evolution of consciousness.

Sloterdijk, in his trilogy *Spheres*, situates the human in the sphere in order to contain them and give them hope, ideological and sociological wombs that hold us. Being human means building spheres. Beginning with the bubbles "microspheric units" of the child mother relationship, moving into globes during the period encompassing the "historico-political world", and finally moving into the contemporary period of foam: "In foam worlds, the individual bubbles are not absorbed into a single, integrative hyper-orb, as in the metaphysical conception of the world, but rather drawn together to form irregular hills". John David Ebert builds on Sloterdijk's spheres by placing a hypersphere between the Judaeo-Christian and Cartesian, and the final foam consciousness, interconnected spheres of meaning (I should explicitly make clear that each persons bubble is still situated within a universal framework). The hypersphere designates the period of the Avant guard where reality is seen as a thing creating and destroying itself over and over.

Deleuze and Guattari use the terms "rhizome" and "rhizomatic" as an "image of thought," that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points. They use multiple images of thought mainly to describe a zone of consciousness we are moving into that Ken Wilber might describe as Centauric or Vision-logic. Deleuze visions a plane of consistency or a body without organs, a deterritorialized space through which movement and becomings can occur, Becomings animal, becomings writer etc.

Psychogeography uses geography, the world we live in and move through, as a generative medium for thoughts and conversely thoughts and concepts form links and our understanding of space shifts through them, allowing re-mappings of space. Will Self would add: that there are different types of thought emerging from the way we move through space. He believes that we are most at home in our bodies and therefore our minds when we are walking "In terms of space the body is still attuned after hundreds of thousands of years to register perception of space at a physical level".

Each persons bubble is now able to vary quite a lot, so there is a lot of room for successful and unsuccessful bubbles. What is left out of this brief review of a shift into a thought space that is post-rational, is that new views of foundation are needed, in order that each bubble in the landscape of foam may be given freedom. as although the bubbles appear to have no hyper-orb this is not actually true. If you don't have a plan you become part of someone else's and more so than ever vast swathes of humanity have been sucked into fewer and larger cathedrals.

## Collapse of world views and evolving for freedom (customisable)

collapse of major worldviews and possibilities for new ones of freedom.

The internal structure of the castle is how we experience the world. Our individualised world view is defined by basic assumptions we make about the world. These are the a priori assumptions upon which the rest of our structure is built. they may be unconscious and obscured to us in which case the castle appears to be floating off the ground. they are however there and if we become aware of them we will be empowered.

Even Derrida was conscious that complete de-construction was impossible, you can't deconstruct deconstruction, and the word sign is a sign, so it cannot be argued against without using the language you are challenging.

After the collapse of classical structures such as the church, and Cartesian space time, hierarchies of order were exploded and fractured. Consciousness then begins to see what can be salvaged, what remains interconnected. There is no clear foundation so our castle of ontology may appear as floating. This psychic realm is structured like Walter Benjamin's Arcades project; it is a collection of interconnecting thoughts, observations and archetypes, forming phantasmagorias that build upon one another. However, in our world removing the base doesn't destroy the structures created by previous civilizations, they remain here for us to reanimate as we see fit. Let's take art as an example; another universe, another castle that enfolds/unfolds itself. We will compare three art theories: John David Ebert's midden heap of post-metaphysical Transcendental Signifiers, Owen Barfield's evolution of consciousness through poetry; forming new alive words from dead ones, and Nigel Cooke's Painting as an Undead medium.

*(in the following paragraph, I almost want to remove ebert entirely. at least i need to present him as incorrect straight away. there is no time that is without metaphysics, it is only obfuscated…. Having a period of time when people are unaware of their roots can lead to some interesting directions, like radioactive effects on genes, it can accelerate change, but it will end in stagnation, and the subjugation of the magician if it isn't brought back into an awareness of roots…. This section is however important. as it is describing to me a kind of mind virus. and it is actually what this book is so important. there is the death of god, and the death of newtonian space-time. it has led to sickness, but leaves room for Mythology Unbound.)*

Ebert divides cultural and art history into three categories: before metaphysics, metaphysical, and after metaphysics. The metaphysical age is a term first used by Heidegger to describe the time beginning with Plato and ending with Nietzsche, the death of god and the deconstruction of meta-narratives. The metaphysical age was made up of many paradigms and hierarchies the largest of which were: The mythological, the Judeo-Christian, and Newtonian-Cartesian space. Over the last hundred years or so these metaphysical hierarchies have been torn down. We can place pivot points signalling the move to a post-metaphysical age in Nietzsche and Heidegger. We now find ourselves in a post metaphysical age; our signs or signifiers no longer point to signifieds that we can point to as transcendental, as unquestionable. For Derrida this is a decentralising notion, the signs are still there but the signified is no longer a known body that we can orbit around. Instead there is an endless play of signification. Ebert suggests, we find ourselves in a midden heap or junk heap of lost signifiers, an artist/protagonist in the new world is relegated to sift through the rubbish heap of deconstructed signifiers, and reconstruct them anew, and develop their own individual world system. I.e. The removal of an overarching worldview allows for individuals to build a world for themselves anew, and to select the signifiers they wish from the midden heap and re-contextualize them in their own system. Every artist can be a monadologist, a self-contained whole, and these individual wholes form a collective/cultural landscape of foam. Take for example the work of Joseph Beuys; he develops his own system of meaning using felt, fat and copper (and to a lesser extent iron wax honey and gold).

Every castle can and should be built in its own way so that it is "living" (see enlivening).

Although Beuys materials and conceptual framework has very old shamanic roots, his new system is extremely creative and individualised.

I'm a fan of Ebert, although I would contend with his use of the midden heap metaphor: though they have been shown to be lacking in transcendental foundations, the metaphysical signifiers of the past still hold on to many of their old connecting systems. A midden heap is a metaphor that lacks any structure, and although ontological structures can be obfuscated, they still exist. Derrida himself viewed a plane of signifiers as infinitely connected, a shifting realm of play, his main point was that they were decentralised. We know that there is no absolute claimable/knowable truth, such as Thor's hammer creating lightning in the sky. but that doesn't remove the conceptual/symbolic linkages of the Nordic world tree. This is still true. My experience is that I can believe in the materialist science around lightning, but that I also find value in the metaphors. just like when we talk of final participation. For example, the world tree is still an incredible picture, with each route going into another realm/world: it is a thought picture of a non "rational" thought space, which are perhaps the most useful conceptual images to contemplate. These mythologies are still conceptually inter-webbed structures, but they have been removed from the realm of truth, along with everything else we know of. We are not in a midden heap, but a land of floating structures, furthermore these structures can be pushed about like balloon animals, or perhaps abandoned space stations fused together to form new rafts or bazaars for disenfranchised space pirates. Studio Ghibli's Howl's moving castle sits well as a picture of post-industrial wasteland magic, as a thought image of a monad. We see magic as hallucinogenic glue that holds together old thought structures and re-combines them in new ways allowing us a movement about a previously unknown landscape.

Barfield views language as an image of consciousness, He tracks the changes in language of different cultures as different ways of thinking. He looks at the origins of language where there weren't as many words, and so one word would often be a holophrase, and would have a wide range of meaning. Language can generally be tracked as moving towards specification, which is good for communication but removes some of the expressive nature of a word with multiple meanings. Our understanding of the world in ancient language was an undivided substance of object and subject, of thoughts and matter, this is something that has been divided out with the necessary specification and awakening of consciousness. Barfield is hopeful that humanity will move back into "[a] final participation" in nature or the world and recover what we have lost but with an encompassing viewpoint. To participate again we must recognize the intrinsic connection between our thoughts and the world as it presents itself to us; there is no objective scientific observation, there can only be a human understanding that arises out of our specific consciousness. In Coleridge's words: We receive but what we give / And in our life alone does Nature live (this could also be a catch phrase for Goethean science which we will go in the Alchemy chapter). Original participation "fires the heart from a source outside itself; the images enliven the heart." In final participation, "it is for the heart to enliven the images." So there is a reversal, modern woman/man must be an active participant; our communion is one of agency.

This very book is written as a foundation for a castle that can be structured for freedom. If you can understand it and apply its principles to your own life. this foundation will allow for the Future Form of the Castle to develop….
