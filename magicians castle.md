## Introduction

### Why this book? 

This book is an instruction manual for freedom. Presenting a view of what is the landscape of reality and what can be achieved within it. The universal framework of consciousness and our unique \"theatre of awareness\". 

The universal framework is the castle, upon which have built our unique perspective, often shaped by cultural, biological, and metaphysical forces beyond our awareness.

It confronts the forces that shape the theatre's construction and offers tools for individuals to restructure their own theatre, optimizing them for personal freedom rather than conforming to the worldviews of the many cultural \"cults\" in which we grow up

Mind and matter are not separate; they are one. We experience ourselves in physical bodies, but these bodies and the world around us are expressions of mind. Through movement, storytelling, ritual, and all forms of embodied experience, Mind manifests itself. Embodiment is the actualization of mind.

Across cultures, various costumes and \"masks\" designate power and significance. These rituals embody the ideas most important to their cultures. For many, this is fulfilling. People find richness in the intricate layers of their inherited cultural embodiments: the Body of Christ, the totem animal, or other sacred symbols. Others, however, find themselves in post-religious, consumerist cultures with their own rituals—sports, music festivals, branding—which often lack the same depth of useful meaning.

For myself and many others, we find ourselves without a clear cultural position, either through migration or exploration of new paradigms. This absence is both a loss and a gift. Without a secure foundation, we face uncertainty. Yet it also opens a vast space for creative freedom—the possibility of building something better. This freedom allows us to take what works for us and develop it into something personal and transformative. We call this process mythology unbound.

Many paradigms of the past have been self-sustaining to the point of limiting the freedom of their disciples. They propagate themselves at the expense of individual potential. These are the cathedrals of cults, religions, materialism, and consumerism, wokism and conservatism —structures designed to perpetuate their own existence.

The opportunity before us is to create reality tunnels that minimize self-propagation and optimize for personal freedom. Could we make a \"cult\" about breaking out of cults? An anarchist matrix?

This is why we must find meaningful movements and embodiments to support the worlds we wish to create. Like the great cathedrals, paradigms, and rituals of the past, we must cast our visions into being.

We would reclaim the power of mythology, visionary art and ritual movement and all forms of integrated spiritual material. and use them to give ourselves the power of the gods. to be creators of our own reality.

you may read this and be questioning our sanity but we assure you we have clear eyes. we know we cannot fly..... but a time is coming soon when we can.

## Idealism

Before we go further we should explain that idealism is taken by us as given. This book is built upon the foundation of Idealism—the understanding that consciousness is fundamental, and what we perceive as the material world is its extrinsic appearance. Materialism assumes that consciousness arises from physical structures, yet it cannot explain how subjective experience emerges from unconscious matter. Neuroscience has shown that deep meditative states, near-death experiences, and psychedelics often result in heightened awareness despite suppressed brain activity, suggesting that consciousness is not merely a product of neural computation.

If mind is primary, then the world we experience is not an objective, mind-independent reality, but rather a shared projection of consciousness. Bernardo Kastrup proposes that what we call the \"physical world\" is simply the outer appearance of mental activity, much like how neurons in a brain are the physical correlate of thoughts and emotions. Just as an individual's conscious experiences are expressed through the body, the universe itself may be the extrinsic appearance of a vast transpersonal consciousness—Mind at Large. In this view, our sense of separateness is an illusion created by dissociation, much like how individuals with dissociative identity disorder experience multiple selves within a single mind.

This perspective aligns with both quantum mechanics and ancient spiritual traditions. The observer effect in quantum physics suggests that reality does not take a definite form until it is observed, undermining the idea of a world that exists independently of consciousness. If perception shapes reality at the most fundamental level, then mind is not something trapped inside the body—it is the very fabric of existence itself.

This book takes Idealism to its natural conclusion: if all is mind, then meaning is not an arbitrary human construct but an intrinsic feature of reality. Unlike religions that seek to transcend suffering by escaping the body, I argue that the purpose of existence is embodiment—the extrusion of mind into understanding. We are not here to dissolve back into an undifferentiated void, but to create, experience, and refine structures that give shape to being.

Rather than viewing existence as something to be endured or escaped, we reclaim it as an act of creative participation. To live is to build, to extrude, to embody. Mind at Large, in its vast and formless state, lacks perspective; it is through our differentiation, our pain, our enjoyment and our unique experiences that the infinite gains self-awareness. We are not here to escape the world—we are here to become it.

## Visualising Reality

The majority of this book will present a physical representation of reality that is understandable to extruded consciousness, in order that we may navigate and evolve. We present reality as a castle of ontology. Which can be divided into three parts. These metaphors are the ground, the castle, and the magician. Each works in a process with the others.

**The Ground:** An image of the mind at large—the infinite consciousness we experience and translate as the universe.

**The Castle:** an extrusion out of the ground of being. An alter that has become dissociated from mind at large, and therefore has an ego. A castle is a dynamic ontological map representing the manifold structures and experiences of being. The castle holds our experience, which is the theatre`of awareness: a vast collection of avatars that are in various states of connection and interaction with one another.

**The Magician:** Our higher self, the creative consciousness that inhabits the castle. The magician receives and creates avatars, which both construct the castle and journey outward to engage with other castles. The magician is the first envelope of the light of consciousness, which illuminates all other avatars including the monkey. The monkey is a tool of the magician which the light of consciousness often mistakes for the magician as it produces internal monologue. The magician evolves the castle whilst the monkey stagnates it.

These metaphors will serve as the foundation for a deeper exploration into the process of navigating infinite being and the coming apocalypse culminating in "real-world outcomes."

This journey invites you to question, imagine, and participate actively in the creation of reality.

## Temporary description of how everything works

*(not to be published but for reference while I'm writing. text resumes at "the ground of being")*

*(some of the parts about angels and grasshoppers could find a place in the rest of the book.)*

There is absolute nothingness. Darkness. From which arises:

Infinite mind at large. the infinite witness, the source of light. Evolution, matter, dimensions (time and space) and physics all must emerge together. They are present as soon as there is a witness. evolution leads to

Extrusions which contain an alter of witness and a Structure which is self building. mind at large uses to gain perspective on itself. and the structure is returned to mind at large to evolve it. The first extrusions were simple structures, blueprints that emerged to prioritise energy patterns and systems of producing and collecting energy. this was the emergence of the

Etheric which created etheric forces in the universe or mind at large upon their reintegration. extrusions next evolved:

Astral bodies. and with the advent of humans

ego, I or higher self (Magician). Humans are the leading edge of evolution and have physical, etheric and astral bodies and an ego. They are the closest mind at large has come to building a bridge between the physical world and the spiritual, as the ego exists in the realm of the spirit. If we want to continue evolution we can develop our ego and transform our lower bodies with it. beyond that which it has already transformed the lower bodies by default: as soon as we had a higher self we also had a:

Lower self (Monkey), which is a mixed bag, it can be used to automate good or bad habits. and it generates a monologue which the witness can mistake for the magician.

As the physical body of humans has evolved first it is our loudest method of communication. However communication may take place in any of the physical, etheric, astral or I realms.

over the eons everything falls back into the spiritual soup, the light of god which blinds and dissolves its newest parts. over time though there is a push back against the spiritual, against the force of entropy and unification.

we eventually will transform our bodies and carry our flowering egos into mind at large and the physical at will. and we may even eventually escape space and time, and if we can keep our flowering ego we will join the gods.

a human baby grows in the same way as the universe. spirit, physical, etheric, astral, ego.

human evolution develops in the same way.

- physical body
- physical world (strongest connection)
- nagual - etheric
- etheric world
- monkey in tonal / astral
- astral world
- magician
- universe ego (weak)
- witness
- universe witness

Humans are the first beings with egos. They are the furthest extrusion. all creatures fall back into infinite being at death.

**Angels:** there are some beings who have never become physical, they do not have an ego but have well structured etheric and astral bodies.

**Ghosts/spirits:** there are also humans with egos that have developed their ego/astral/etheric so that they stay structured in the spirit world.

furthermore the extrusions require structure and apparatus beyond that of the universal mind. there is a sense of a higher self that emerges simultaneously with extruded awareness, and a lower self that we evolved to navigate the world of physics/matter. within the realms of our extruded mind are also all related and unrelated concepts that come into us.

as a thought experiment take grasshoppers. They are also metabolising and therefore extrusions. however their higher self is more of a group soul. and it is very underdeveloped and undifferentiated from their lower self. There is something about humans which makes us unique: we have separated lower from higher self. separating out survival and creativity. These two selves are now in competition. Perhaps there is more that can be differentiated in order that we might evolve further?

there is the ground of being (which is also an extrusion, but it may be confusing for the reader to hear until later). This ground of being is a mind at large. it probably has a consciousness which may have some similarities to us.

Many mystical experiences—whether induced by deep meditation, psychedelics, or near-death states—describe encounters with an infinite, silent, all-seeing awareness that permeates everything.

**Gnosticism:** The idea that the universe is a testing ground or a school for the soul, where it can learn and evolve to ultimately return to its divine source.

## The Ground of Being

There is absolute nothingness from which arises Infinite mind at large. Evolution, matter, physics and dimensions of time and space all must emerge together. This is because a universe is made of something as opposed to nothing. this something we call matter, and to be matter it must have variation otherwise it would have no meaning, it would be absolutely flat. so we must also have a way of matter interacting with itself which we call physics, which must also occur in dimension. The types of physics, matter and dimension might vary from universe to universe but they are part of the definition of a universe. Evolution must also exist in a universe. as matter is a resource which can be used by a system to make more of itself. matter then tends towards self ordering systems.

So all these parts are present as soon as there is a witness. i.e. mind at large.

The ground of being is the mind at large, it is the infinite witness. Infinite consciousness. It is so unified that it lacks the ability to see itself from one point. Over time systems of matter emerge which are local by definition. they become structured and an aspect of the infinite witness can become extruded and gain perspective. This perspective is then gifted back to the infinite mind in order to enrich it and generate better extrusions. We humans are an outcome of this process, and there is much further to go. Each extrusion contains more structure between physical and witness. our higher self Or "I" is the latest addition to extrusion, and as such it is our most powerful and our most underdeveloped. eventually we may use it to restructure all other developed layers.

Infinite consciousness has all the answers but lacks the ability to ask questions. Whereas dissociated human consciousness acquires perspective and the ability to question.

Active Imagination is the bridge between Mind at Large and the individual self. It is the process of inquiry—the act of asking questions and listening for answers. Through this process, we shape our realities, linking ideas to form new structures of experience. Imagination is not idle fantasy but the mechanism of world creation. When we illuminate something previously unseen, we are not merely discovering—we are participating in the act of creation itself.

This interplay between discovery and creation is evident in every moment of perception. If I see a rock and turn it over to examine what lies beneath, the act of revealing is an act of world-building. The question I ask—"What does me + the spacetime position of this rock equal?"—is met with an answer that is filtered through my belief system, my framework of reality.

Mind at Large seeks to know itself, yet it can only do so through us—through individuated consciousness shining a light into the unknown. We are not passive observers but active participants in the unfolding of infinity. The world we experience is drawn from an infinite field of possibilities, shaped by the questions we ask and the dimensions we choose to explore.

If we limit our questions simply to our position of Cartesian space-time we limit the range of answers from the infinite. We need to combine ideas such as philosophy, economics, spirituality, mysticism, magic, and above all the knowledge that all of this including space-time is an illusion. The more dimensions we explore the further our spectrum of consciousness will reach.

The Ground of Being is limitless, but it requires explorers to give it shape. Our task is not just to witness, but to extrude, embody, and create—to bring forth new realities from the boundless potential of Mind at Large.

## The primacy of the imagination

> "We shouldn't talk about fantastic literature because we don't know to what genre the universe belongs; if it is fantastic or real" — Borges

Given that we are accepting Bernardo Kastrup's Idealist ontology where Mind is everything, the importance of imagination is readily apparent. Imagination is the process of structuring, not merely leisurely pursuit of escapist fantasy. It is the very bedrock of experience. It is the process by which the world is made available to us; the process by which the castle is structured. Coleridge calls this the primary imagination. This differentiates itself from secondary imagination and fantasy. Secondary imagination we would call fine art. And fantasy is zombie replication, or stagnating unspeaking art.

Husserl would call primary imagination the natural attitude, "the spontaneous belief that the world which is there is simply given." Husserl would add that a shift could be made in primary imagination, once we observe that seeing is actually an act of creating. This shift he calls the epoché, the temporary suspension of belief. So his contribution is that becoming aware of the fabrication of the world, allows us to see the world, without being lost in it. Furthermore, to become aware of the creative act may give us some agency over this force.

Is reality mind or matter? Most materialists would suggest that our perception of consciousness is an illusion, and is simply a product of evolutionary forces and deterministic neurons firing. This argument is full of paradox, it uses mind to argue against mind. Furthermore the very idea of observable material itself is undermined if we follow out the logic of natural selection. Donald D. Hoffman uses computer modelling to show us that our perceptions are hallucinations that help us to survive in the world rather than being a perception of an objective reality. "Our perceptions have evolved through natural selection for utility rather than a perception of truth. Seeing the truth isn't efficient."

## Extrusion

## The Castle

The structure of experience is a castle, a spatial construction of consciousness extruded from mind at large. Mind at large is both mind and physical, a single substance like a Möbius strip that appears to have two sides but is truly one. However extrusions, or castles, join witness and physical without using a Mobius strip, instead forming a structured chain of being. Over time, castles have evolved, growing in complexity from plants to animals to humans. Within an individual's lifetime, the castle's structure can shift as our understanding of the world transforms.

Our extrusions contain many qualities in common with other extrusions, especially with our fellow human extrusions. Any metabolising being is extruded, but humans are more structured and potent.

the castle localises mind at large, building a bridge between the local witness and physical reality. For humans we form a higher self around our witness, and around that we form a world conception along with a lower self or a monkey self. This then acts upon a further link that is an energetic medium, or a powerful zone of unconsciousness, before it reaches physical reality as we know it.

Within this structure in humans, there is vast room for customisation. the higher self or ego may be barely there or very strong. the lower self can be in service of the higher self, or it can be a zombie tyrant. There is variance in our emotional understanding of the world, our experience of time and space, variance in life force, our pattern recognition, and so on. but out of all these our world conception varies the most widely.

The world conception is visualised as a grand theatre inside the castle. The structure of the theatre is often changing. There are so many ways for the world to be understood. Whole worlds may exist within this theatre which is vast and cavernous. someone living in a highly animistic or deeply mythological framework that predates organized religion or abstract philosophy will construct a theatre where nature is alive and full of spirits. someone deeply embedded in hyper-rationalism or scientism, where materialism defines reality, and spirituality is dismissed, will have a very different stage, one that is perhaps more representative of modern culture. Finally someone that blends technological and spiritual paradigms, embracing integration through futuristic or transhumanist lenses and spotlights will have another stage construction built, for their own purpose, to find the patterns they are looking for.

The Infinite consciousness of the ground of being contains all the answers but it lacks the ability to see itself, and it also lacks the ability to ask questions. We perceive the ground of being as the physical universe. Our castle is temporarily catalysed and extricated out of the universal net, gaining perspective and partially losing our connectedness. The higher from the earth we grow the more perspective we have, but the harder it is for us to connect to our rhizomatic and mycelial roots, this is what we must do however, and we must do it in two ways, by feeling down into our depths, and by watching from our position of perspective the infinite mycelial net that surrounds us. We must do both at once otherwise we will move into the pre-rational Dionysian or the rational Apollonian. We must be like the centaur; its lower body is its connection to dream, its head and hands pointing at the target.

## The Magician

The magician is our higher self. our god self, christ self, buddha self. it is a part of us that is very close to formless pure witness. The magician is the first form that arises around an extruded witness. It is often unseen by us as it is newly evolved and only faint. It is something we need to cultivate, a true awareness of self. As opposed to false perception of self awareness, that is actually the robotic monkey self which our mind has created to automate basic function and survival.

The Magician uses the castle to gain perspective over the lands. His/her castle becomes a vessel that may journey over the ground of infinite being. With it, the magician can contemplate, engage or dance with the mind at large, which we observe from our castle, mediated by the theatre of avatars. Upon the death of what we understand as our physical body the castle is subsumed into the earth, the castle will once again become part of the ground of being and mind at large. The wizard may be drowned in this ocean as they re-enter universal consciousness. Their perspective is lost. Agency is sacrificed for communion.

The theatre of awareness resides within the castle, it is the area of which we are conscious. The rest of the castle is an unconscious background for the theatre.

The eye of the witness resides in the magician, who is often unaware of their own presence. If they are able to listen to themselves they will unlock profound wisdom. This is our genius, our higher self. This is synonymous with the genius as understood in ancient Rome, however at that time it was still thought of as a being outside of ourselves, which we experience as part of ourselves. nonetheless it is the same thing.

The magician ego is something which has a portal into the logos, that is, a network of egos that communicate directly without the need to pass through the physical world. Sometimes this sounds like our own voice and sometimes it is the voice of another.

when a psychotic is hearing voices though they have begun to see their magician as other and their monkey as self. This can lead to a rejection of self and a darkening of that ego into a spiteful god.

*(poetic but not sure if it adds here: Although to live most fully is to climb the mountain our energy comes from the sea. We constantly call from the mountain to hear what the ocean has to say in return. As we listen to it we are filled with life force to climb higher and sing even more beautiful questions.)*

A wizard never leaves his/her castle; they are connected to it in a symbiotic relationship. Even if a castle has been "driven" across the land right next to another castle, the wizards cannot communicate directly, as that would require emerging from the castle which is not possible until death. Instead communication between wizards is only achieved through the summoning or casting of avatars. The avatar will visit the magician at each other's castle. And becomes part of their theatre to varying degrees.

When I read a book, avatars come to my castle. When I interact with you, your avatar, and the avatars that make up our conversation come to my castle.

A Magician has the ability to pull avatars out of everything in the physical universe. The power of their mind and imagination brings life to all things, all things are given a voice.

A good spell will create a strong avatar. It will be highly living and highly restructuring. Its beauty will allow it entrance to a castle and allow it to integrate. an even better spell is a collection of avatars, like a circus troupe.

**Summoning** - bring to your castle - may involve physical action but can be done purely mentally

**Casting** - send to others castles. Requires physical action to create informational energy to appear in another wizard's castle.

Castles are infectious. A living castle may enliven another.

**Monkey mind** = self generated zombie avatar. This is an avatar we have created in our own image which the light of consciousness often mistakes for the magician. In reality there may be many false conceptions of self, monkey's zombies or other forms. but for simplicity's sake we will just use the metaphor of "the monkey". When the Monkey wears the crown the castle withers. It becomes stagnant. It does however still produce avatars unconsciously and these may infect other surrounding castles. The monkey avatar self has no imagination. They do not have the ability to integrate the chaos which constantly surrounds us. And as we know if we do not integrate it both chaos and order may become pathological.

---

## Avatars

A magician interacts with the world through avatars. He can never see another magician directly nor can he see the ground of being directly (mind at large). He only sees the avatars that they create. Consciousness does not directly meet other consciousness, certainly not in a physical or mental way at any rate. And nor does our consciousness meet mind at large. When you meet someone you instead meet their image presented to you. They have "cast" their image through their presence and their action or inaction. This can be in the form of: painting, speaking, dancing, writing. Even when we are sleeping our body is generating an avatar of its image which is received by others.

This image or avatar then travels across the ground of being to your castle where it is escorted by your own avatars to meet your magician. Avatars are never solo, always multiple, always in dialogue. The avatars generated by the ground of being include space, time, and all matter. The image of the neuron firing represents the physical understanding of a thought. The image of stars and planets revolving represents the physical understanding of mind at large.

In addition to casting a wizard may also summon: When we take an action that generates a new avatar, by looking at art, reading, consuming any media, or by imagining.

it is worth investigating two types of avatars: both non verbal (thought forms) and verbal (voices)

![Valley of the thought embodied stones, Harry Zed Hughes, 120x180cm]

In terms of painting practice the psychic landscape may encompass either verbal or non-verbal avatars. In the above example I would say it leans more towards non-verbal rather than the narrative stages of history painting that include the verbal iconography of personages (see the picnic at the end of time)

---

## The unconscious

there needs perhaps to be a separate section where we talk about those aspects which are beyond comprehension. and which nonetheless have entered into our castle in some way. they are unspeakable. and yet they do exist. they sit between the tonal and the ground of being. they are intuition and a vast wisdom that we cannot comprehend, they are without many of the limiting valves that sit closer to our conception of self, time and world. and thus they may hold extreme power and truth, as they are close to the sea of pure beautiful chaos. to the face of god.

These unconscious forces enter only the very outskirts of the castle, they have not yet collapsed to a particle state.

In Nietzsche, there is no universal truth. The truthfulness of truth is at once a lie. Untruth, Nietzsche tells us, is "a condition of life". Everything for Nietzsche, including the reception of his work, is a mask. "Every philosophy", he writes, "also conceals a philosophy; every opinion is also a hiding-place, every word also a mask". *(does this quote fit here?)*

Affirmed divergence props itself up and forms feedback loops. Much like the ancient holophrase of Barfield, where multiple meanings occupied single words, as in the Greek word pneuma meaning breath, spirit, or wind; or Lie meaning deception or place: signing is hallucinatory, every word is a mask.

The map is not the territory. All structures are fundamentally maya. However we do gain something to re-gift back to the ground of being by extruding.

There is no fundamental right way to structure the interior of the castle as there is an inevitable collapse of the wave function to make it function.

masks, are another name for an avatar. and when we reach out to the unconscious we are confronted with powerful forces and beings which have not collapsed into graspable particle yet.

> "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern"

The "narrow cavern" is akin to Castaneda's "tonal", and it is surely the "nagual" that is the hallucination, or perhaps more specifically behind the hallucination. *(text could benefit from a more in depth introduction to nagual and tonal)*

The astral/nagual produces a hallucination (i.e. the tonal) in order for you to cognise it: 

> "Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this particular planet."

I would go further and say that the further we get to the source of the nagual, the more the tonal is activated and energized to try and cognize what is coming to you. As we go about business as usual in a materialist/capitalist society we are far from the nagual and so your tonal is also deactivated and mostly dead in its symbology and linkage. As we move closer to becoming sorcerer, to the nagual the tonal is activated and energized. This simultaneous contrast forms a feedback loop that props itself up, and intensifies itself in every effort to de-stabilize it, through removing another layer of the tonal/the valve/ the cavern, as we head toward the Nagual/ astral/ Infinity/ transcendental object at the end of time/ final participation

---

## Thought Forms

*(astral communication)*

*(how is this different from the previous section on the unconscious? in the section below i talk about it as the nagual again but i think thought forms are actually in the tonal but close to the nagual.)*

There is an image world that is structured very differently than our currently accepted logical language. It is the world of thought forms. It can be found at night before bed, as one closes one's eyes, through the use of hallucinogens or in dreams.

It presents us with a non logic: akin to Castaneda's accounts in his books on the teachings of Don Juan, there are two forms of reality, the tonal and the nagual. "In order to talk about it we must borrow from the island of the tonal, therefore it is more convenient not to explain it but to simply recount its effects." "a voice that comes from the depths, the voice of the nagual." "You may die if you come into direct physical contact with the nagual". This is the idea of seeing the face of god which you may die from or at least go mad.

There is an occult tradition of seeing thought forms often emanating from auras, Annie Besant in her book with C.W. Leadbeater *Thought Forms* (1901) depicts thought forms as real things that can be created intentionally or unintentionally by an entity, it could be a nature spirit, a dead person or a living person, and then could be observed by another with the correct "sight". She divided thought forms into three types: the shape of the person that creates them, all other shapes recognised as a visualisation of a physical world object, and finally abstract forms representing astral or mental planes. I find her classification strange; I would simply classify thought forms as the third category, abstract forms that may represent astral and mental planes. I would leave visualisations of realistic objects out of it in their own category.

In the book there are some illustrations of vibration plates and pendulums that produce geometric patterns, the similarity to the images produced by thought forms is noted. It is hypothesized that just as two opposing (or of differing ratios) forces produce physical patterns of resonance, so too the thought forms may be a production of multiple forces intermingling and producing resonances. This is an interesting suggestion, bearing fruits of analogy: perhaps the astral is always in dissonance, always in a state of becoming, "all becomings are written like sorcerers' drawings on [the] plane of consistency". The plane of consistency is "the ultimate Door providing a way out" for becomings. Aldous Huxley's *Doors of Perception* open an astral imaging, an opening onto infinite resonances all the way into "the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infinity"

Returning to Besant's book *Thought Forms*, we find two illustrations produced by pendulums that spark our interest:

[Images would go here]

These images are so similar to psychedelic imagery, there was no widespread western mushroom or mescaline use in the 19th century, only opium which produced dream states and hallucinations of a sort, although not visually intricate patterns, not intensely conscious visualisations. I think these forms are consistent with some kind of fundamental perception in human experience; whether or not it is representative of an astral plane. However wouldn't it be more interesting to use these visualisations as another interpretive layer? *(needs elaboration, seems important)*

## The Logos

*(higher self/ego communication)*

*("voices" and "thought forms" are more of a gradation than delineated.)*

*(in this section we introduce the idea of genius. In Roman tradition, genius was a guiding spirit that connected an individual to the divine. It wasn't the person's mind or talent but rather a force that worked through them. it is the same as the logos and the ego or magician)*

There is a consciousness that accompanies thought forms, this can also come in the form of voices. McKenna calls it Logos: the voice in the head that people had in the Greco roman world – what people were striving for, that told you how to live and gave you answers. For example Socrates had a daemon that was his crap detector, an invisible agency speaking from hyperspace. This Logos/Gaian mind apparently fell silent around the time of Christ, perhaps as a result of the ego entering fully into the human. Anyhow it still seems to pop up now and then: McKenna recounts the dream Descartes had whilst he was a young soldier that changed his life and history in a new direction. An angel came to him and told him that conquest is to be achieved through number and measurement. Modern scientific materialism was founded by an angel.

Mckenna's own visions often involve "self-transforming machine elves", "There are forces friendly to our struggle to birth ourselves as an intelligent species". "Right here and now, one quanta away, there is raging a universe of active intelligence that is transhuman, hyperdimensional, and extremely alien." These are beings from another dimension of which Steiner perhaps has had similar visions?: "The gnomes laugh us to scorn on account of the groping, struggling understanding with which we manage to grasp one thing or another…gnomes become ironical to the point of ill manners if one speaks to them of logic ... Thus the gnomes, inside the earth, are actually the bearers of the ideas of the universe"

As for me, as I have stated earlier my voices have never spoken aloud but have been knowings that have come to me, these are perhaps just my imagination, or perhaps the imagination itself gives us something more solid than we give it credit for. *(change to us, we, our?)*

## The Theatre

### Hyperspheric shadow

*(Mind at large is hyperspheric, extrusions collapse the quantum wave function to a particle. the interior of mind space must be made 3d so that we may actually navigate it. so here we discuss the problems of visualising hyperspheric reality and after maybe we should talk about kabbalah?)*

Hyperspheric thinking extends within experience to all the layers of reality we experience: the universe, galaxy, solar system, Earth, and the Human Body.

History is a series of black holes holding other black holes, universes in universes. The present is another universe, birthed by all previous eras, the latest baby babushka doll. And simultaneously, evolution envelops the past retroactively. Our reptilian brain is enveloped by our mammalian brain, which is enveloped by our neocortex; archaic consciousness is enveloped by mythic consciousness, which is enveloped by rational consciousness, which is enveloped by a post-rational consciousness. Past and future forms of consciousness can be seen as simultaneous interiors and exteriors. So we are in a hyperspheric universe, and to visualise and understand the structure of experience, we see dynamic hyperspheric allegories.

Let us try and understand the hypersphere: As we move through the dimensions from a 0D point, to a 1D line (with 2 points), to a 2D square (with 4 points), and a 3D cube (with 8 points), we reach another theoretical dimension, the 4D, and its object along this progression, the hyper cube (with 16 points). Just as each previous dimension added has doubled the existing points and structure, so too does the 4th dimension; the cube stretches out into the fourth dimension. See illustration of hypercube. The hypercube is visualised in 3d space as a cube that engulfs another cube but that is simultaneously engulfed by that cube. This 3d visualisation can be further understood by animation, just like a torus or hair scrunchy can revolve so that the outside becomes the inside, so can a hypercube, except that with a hyper cube there isn't negative and positive space, it's all positive, so imagine the negative space of a scrunchy also being filled in. one negative space each in the middle, top and bottom of the scrunchy, and one on the left, right, forward and back. We can see there exists 7 cubes within a hyper cube, and each one could be folded into the centre of the 3d visualisation of the hypercube space.

For an animation of the hypercube projection see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtSNStVW81M

A hyperspace is a good way to visualise our castle, as our cube of reference can shift, and each enfolder can become brought into focus and visualised by the witness in its time.

The history of the universe can be seen as a generation of further enfoldings through time. Atoms exist first and soon generate molecules, which enfold them, and then single cell organisms which enfold atoms, then neuronal organisms, neural cord organisms, the reptilian brain stem, the limbic system, and the neo cortex enfolds all of these previous levels.

These states of evolution also correspond to the evolution of consciousness locomotive=neural cord, archaic= neo cortex, magic = complex neo cortex, and then we get to further states of consciousness, and each state encompasses the last: Magic, mythic, rational, and Centauric. Or socially: village, empire, nation, and planetary. You get the picture… maybe. Anyway the main thing to grasp is how the next level must encompass the last.

At the same time we find ourselves unfolding in the other direction. We find our complex systems of life in the biosphere of the earth, in the solar system, in the galaxy, in the universe, which is perhaps one in a multiverse pea and ham soup type situation. So this complexity finds itself on the inside, as opposed to the outside that the neocortex finds itself on.

If we move to the human experience of the present, we may see that time enfolds in both directions: The now surrounds all previous time while at once being surrounded by all previous time. We are shaped by time, but we also retroactively change time by our decisions, actions, and perhaps most importantly our creations (see retroactive force, in the Tidal wave chapter)

Rudolf Steiner introduced an idea of Counterspace that I believe describes the six enfolding cubes of the central cube in the hypercube. Counterspace can be seen as the mirror image of Euclidean space. Instead of the plane at infinity, the point is at infinity. Everywhere is the centre. An example of this is his picture of the head torso and limbs of the human being. Steiner takes Goethe's theories of morphology as a casting off point. Noting Goethe's experience of finding a lamb's skull in a field and on observation coming to conclusion that the forms of the skull can be seen as morphed vertebrae. Steiner takes the image of a morphed skull into the limbs of the human, and asks us to imagine a sock being turned inside out, thus the limb bone is an inverted skull. The skull is a complete image of itself, forming a complete sphere; the torso is only a partial physicalisation of its true soul sphere form, but once we reach the limbs the bones have been turned inside out, and the entire universe is the sphere, the limbs are a tiny slither of a physicalized plane that forms the circumference of a sphere that's origin is located everywhere/in infinity. Steiner has given us another example of Counterspace, and we may also draw from this human image one of the Castle. Because the castle describes all levels of our reality: the universe, galaxy, solar system, Earth, and the Human Body.

This image of the human places the head as purely body, the torso as body and soul, and the limbs as body soul and spirit. This is yet another example of a simultaneous reversal of structure, instead of the traditional understanding of the head being our most evolved/perfected aspect.

## Evolving world conceptions (customisable)

There is a clear ontological progression that takes place with individuals and civilisations. We begin with a single foundation stone; this lifts us out of the unified ground of being. The stone also acts as our sense organ, which at this early stage is one dimensional and minimal bandwidth. A baby sends out impulses and sees what they receive. Out of a chaotic soup of sense perceptions rhythms begin to emerge. Allowing the child to begin to differentiate. Differentiation allows categorisation and navigation. Space and primitive time are unlocked. We extend our limbs into the world and open new sense organs. Our castle becomes a basic home with doors and windows and a roof. It has successfully lifted the magician out of the soup of infinite being. For example we might have a simple teepee for our castle, with a gravitational pull of love that holds everything down. While a tensile strength of pragmatic enquiry stops the castle from collapsing. The magician may now receive and summon avatars to further aid in the construction of the castle.

[Diagram would go here]

When it is healthy the castle is in a constant state of restructuring. Avatars integrate with the structure around them as they enter the castle.

As the castle grows and integrates further dimensions or paradigms it becomes harder to visualise. It moves beyond the 3 dimensional into the hyperspheric.

As the castle grows it transforms, evolving through various structures. As the castle evolves it swings back and forth between chaos and order. New chaos is continually integrated into the body of the castle, i.e. order. The castle moves from pre-rational, to rational, to post-rational, to neo-rational.

| Pre-rational | rational | Post-rational | Neo-rational |
|--------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| disassociated chaos | structured | dislocated clusters of structure/paradigms | integrated multi paradigm structure |
| (antithesis) | thesis (synthesis) | antithesis | synthesis (thesis) |

Out of a magical shamanic past humankind went through a period of Euclidean hierarchy building in religion and science, after which post-structuralist and post-modern thought popped the bubbles; exploding the structures of the past into a midden heap of diverse paradigms with no apparent hierarchical depth. There have been various attempts to re-integrate these paradigms into a hypersphere, which is an intermediary structure on our path back to graspability and embodiment. Multiple dimensions of the hypersphere are finally relocated back into Euclidean space; the final structure is the kabbalistic tree, wherein the previous chaos can be metabolised into something navigable to a perceiving alter.

The castle begins in the most basic form as a pile, a simple form of consciousness, of action and reaction, pleasure and pain. At the second stage the castle becomes rationalised and we learn to delineate. Consciousness becomes more complex as it integrates other paradigms; a process of allowing a chaotic element from the outside of the castle to be integrated and held by its ordering structure. This can continue for a long time, in a human life for much of childhood, until we come across a paradigm that we have not allowed room for in our structure, and if the body of the castle has become calcified it may fracture at this point. This might happen when we come across relativity, or quantum mechanics, or the singularity of the big bang. It might happen if we question the paradigm we are using to build the rest of our structure upon. Say if we question our religion, or the validity of space-time.

[Diagram would go here]

At this point our structures may become disassembled. We are left with a midden heap of transcendental signifieds. Upon which ordering structures begin to rebuild whether we are conscious of it or not. And if we don't have a plan we will become part of someone else's plan. We may fall victim to an organising structure that is dictated to us by our consumer society, in which case we will eventually be consumed by the cathedral (chronos, the consuming mother). Or we can begin down a path of awakening and unification which leads first to the hypersphere and then to the Kabbalistic tree of life.

## stages of consciousness

Thought-space is the picture provided when we construct consciousness spatially. Many types of consciousness are visualised in different ways, resulting in different thought spaces.

This is an alchemical or hallucinogenic way of looking at thought, in that it is associative and morphic. Several theorists have developed the thought space concept: Jean Gebser, Ken Wilber, Peter Sloterdijk, John David Ebert, Deleuze and Guattari all generate spatial images of an evolving consciousness. The psychogeographers and Will Self demonstrate a further step of using the spatial nature of the physical world to change the way we think, and vice versa, the way we think restructuring the physical world.

Jean Gebser's dimensions of consciousness are dimensional: **Archaic structure** is 0 dimensional, it is the first structure to emerge from "the ever-present origin", "The human being was totally immersed in the world unable to extricate himself or herself from that world". They were identical with that world. **Magic structure** is 1 dimensional, humans have a sense of being separate from the world around them but are not yet in their ego, language emerges as word magic so that objects and people are magically related. **Mythic structure** is 2 dimensional, we are now conscious of the other, it is a consciousness of polarities, memory and feeling interact and create religion. **Mental/Rational structure** is 3 dimensional, here we have the Hegelian trinity of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The rational epoch "required centuries to sufficiently devitalize and demythologize the word so that it was able to express distinct concepts freed from the wealth of imagery, as well as to reach the rationalistic extreme where the word, once a power [magic] and later an image [myth], was degraded to a mere formula." An attribute of rational consciousness, being 3d, is that it is now perspectival. **Integral structure** is 4 dimensional, it is a-perspectival, a fourth dimension arrives as an "irruption of qualitative time into our consciousness.", and it becomes post-rational, encompassing many of the rational-structural movements along with magical origins. For further reading Ken Wilber draws on Gebser as well as Aurobindo, Piaget and Fowler to develop a more complex layering of the evolution of consciousness.

Sloterdijk, in his trilogy *Spheres*, situates the human in the sphere in order to contain them and give them hope, ideological and sociological wombs that hold us. Being human means building spheres. Beginning with the bubbles "microspheric units" of the child mother relationship, moving into globes during the period encompassing the "historico-political world", and finally moving into the contemporary period of foam: "In foam worlds, the individual bubbles are not absorbed into a single, integrative hyper-orb, as in the metaphysical conception of the world, but rather drawn together to form irregular hills". John David Ebert builds on Sloterdijk's spheres by placing a hypersphere between the Judaeo-Christian and Cartesian, and the final foam consciousness, interconnected spheres of meaning (I should explicitly make clear that each persons bubble is still situated within a universal framework). The hypersphere designates the period of the Avant guard where reality is seen as a thing creating and destroying itself over and over.

Deleuze and Guattari use the terms "rhizome" and "rhizomatic" as an "image of thought," that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points. They use multiple images of thought mainly to describe a zone of consciousness we are moving into that Ken Wilber might describe as Centauric or Vision-logic. Deleuze visions a plane of consistency or a body without organs, a deterritorialized space through which movement and becomings can occur, Becomings animal, becomings writer etc.

Psychogeography uses geography, the world we live in and move through, as a generative medium for thoughts and conversely thoughts and concepts form links and our understanding of space shifts through them, allowing re-mappings of space. Will Self would add: that there are different types of thought emerging from the way we move through space. He believes that we are most at home in our bodies and therefore our minds when we are walking "In terms of space the body is still attuned after hundreds of thousands of years to register perception of space at a physical level".

Each persons bubble is now able to vary quite a lot, so there is a lot of room for successful and unsuccessful bubbles. What is left out of this brief review of a shift into a thought space that is post-rational, is that new views of foundation are needed, in order that each bubble in the landscape of foam may be given freedom. as although the bubbles appear to have no hyper-orb this is not actually true. If you don't have a plan you become part of someone else's and more so than ever vast swathes of humanity have been sucked into fewer and larger cathedrals.

## Collapse of world views and evolving for freedom (customisable)

collapse of major worldviews and possibilities for new ones of freedom.

The internal structure of the castle is how we experience the world. Our individualised world view is defined by basic assumptions we make about the world. These are the a priori assumptions upon which the rest of our structure is built. they may be unconscious and obscured to us in which case the castle appears to be floating off the ground. they are however there and if we become aware of them we will be empowered.

Even Derrida was conscious that complete de-construction was impossible, you can't deconstruct deconstruction, and the word sign is a sign, so it cannot be argued against without using the language you are challenging.

After the collapse of classical structures such as the church, and Cartesian space time, hierarchies of order were exploded and fractured. Consciousness then begins to see what can be salvaged, what remains interconnected. There is no clear foundation so our castle of ontology may appear as floating. This psychic realm is structured like Walter Benjamin's Arcades project; it is a collection of interconnecting thoughts, observations and archetypes, forming phantasmagorias that build upon one another. However, in our world removing the base doesn't destroy the structures created by previous civilizations, they remain here for us to reanimate as we see fit. Let's take art as an example; another universe, another castle that enfolds/unfolds itself. We will compare three art theories: John David Ebert's midden heap of post-metaphysical Transcendental Signifiers, Owen Barfield's evolution of consciousness through poetry; forming new alive words from dead ones, and Nigel Cooke's Painting as an Undead medium.

*(in the following paragraph, I almost want to remove ebert entirely. at least i need to present him as incorrect straight away. there is no time that is without metaphysics, it is only obfuscated…. Having a period of time when people are unaware of their roots can lead to some interesting directions, like radioactive effects on genes, it can accelerate change, but it will end in stagnation, and the subjugation of the magician if it isn't brought back into an awareness of roots…. This section is however important. as it is describing to me a kind of mind virus. and it is actually what this book is so important. there is the death of god, and the death of newtonian space-time. it has led to sickness, but leaves room for Mythology Unbound.)*

Ebert divides cultural and art history into three categories: before metaphysics, metaphysical, and after metaphysics. The metaphysical age is a term first used by Heidegger to describe the time beginning with Plato and ending with Nietzsche, the death of god and the deconstruction of meta-narratives. The metaphysical age was made up of many paradigms and hierarchies the largest of which were: The mythological, the Judeo-Christian, and Newtonian-Cartesian space. Over the last hundred years or so these metaphysical hierarchies have been torn down. We can place pivot points signalling the move to a post-metaphysical age in Nietzsche and Heidegger. We now find ourselves in a post metaphysical age; our signs or signifiers no longer point to signifieds that we can point to as transcendental, as unquestionable. For Derrida this is a decentralising notion, the signs are still there but the signified is no longer a known body that we can orbit around. Instead there is an endless play of signification. Ebert suggests, we find ourselves in a midden heap or junk heap of lost signifiers, an artist/protagonist in the new world is relegated to sift through the rubbish heap of deconstructed signifiers, and reconstruct them anew, and develop their own individual world system. I.e. The removal of an overarching worldview allows for individuals to build a world for themselves anew, and to select the signifiers they wish from the midden heap and re-contextualize them in their own system. Every artist can be a monadologist, a self-contained whole, and these individual wholes form a collective/cultural landscape of foam. Take for example the work of Joseph Beuys; he develops his own system of meaning using felt, fat and copper (and to a lesser extent iron wax honey and gold).

Every castle can and should be built in its own way so that it is "living" (see enlivening).

Although Beuys materials and conceptual framework has very old shamanic roots, his new system is extremely creative and individualised.

I'm a fan of Ebert, although I would contend with his use of the midden heap metaphor: though they have been shown to be lacking in transcendental foundations, the metaphysical signifiers of the past still hold on to many of their old connecting systems. A midden heap is a metaphor that lacks any structure, and although ontological structures can be obfuscated, they still exist. Derrida himself viewed a plane of signifiers as infinitely connected, a shifting realm of play, his main point was that they were decentralised. We know that there is no absolute claimable/knowable truth, such as Thor's hammer creating lightning in the sky. but that doesn't remove the conceptual/symbolic linkages of the Nordic world tree. This is still true. My experience is that I can believe in the materialist science around lightning, but that I also find value in the metaphors. just like when we talk of final participation. For example, the world tree is still an incredible picture, with each route going into another realm/world: it is a thought picture of a non "rational" thought space, which are perhaps the most useful conceptual images to contemplate. These mythologies are still conceptually inter-webbed structures, but they have been removed from the realm of truth, along with everything else we know of. We are not in a midden heap, but a land of floating structures, furthermore these structures can be pushed about like balloon animals, or perhaps abandoned space stations fused together to form new rafts or bazaars for disenfranchised space pirates. Studio Ghibli's Howl's moving castle sits well as a picture of post-industrial wasteland magic, as a thought image of a monad. We see magic as hallucinogenic glue that holds together old thought structures and re-combines them in new ways allowing us a movement about a previously unknown landscape.

Barfield views language as an image of consciousness, He tracks the changes in language of different cultures as different ways of thinking. He looks at the origins of language where there weren't as many words, and so one word would often be a holophrase, and would have a wide range of meaning. Language can generally be tracked as moving towards specification, which is good for communication but removes some of the expressive nature of a word with multiple meanings. Our understanding of the world in ancient language was an undivided substance of object and subject, of thoughts and matter, this is something that has been divided out with the necessary specification and awakening of consciousness. Barfield is hopeful that humanity will move back into "[a] final participation" in nature or the world and recover what we have lost but with an encompassing viewpoint. To participate again we must recognize the intrinsic connection between our thoughts and the world as it presents itself to us; there is no objective scientific observation, there can only be a human understanding that arises out of our specific consciousness. In Coleridge's words: We receive but what we give / And in our life alone does Nature live (this could also be a catch phrase for Goethean science which we will go in the Alchemy chapter). Original participation "fires the heart from a source outside itself; the images enliven the heart." In final participation, "it is for the heart to enliven the images." So there is a reversal, modern woman/man must be an active participant; our communion is one of agency.

This very book is written as a foundation for a castle that can be structured for freedom. If you can understand it and apply its principles to your own life. this foundation will allow for the Future Form of the Castle to develop….

## Shared Avatars

*(also called cults, or cathedrals)*

There is a social dynamic that arises between castles as they share their avatars.

Certain avatars may get stronger as they are reinforced and become dominant in reshaping a group's castles. An Ideology is a particular group of avatars that is self-strengthening, this creates a symbiotic relationship that usually allows for the castle construction to be mostly automated. Some examples are Catholicism, Communism, Consumerism, all cults, and all movements. Some of these "cults" are profoundly positively transformative. They usually help a person to shed one reality tunnel and reinstate a new one. Their success lies in "brainwashing" like a baptism, in which you are able to shed "what no longer serves you". Within a social structure or a cult we are rewarded or punished for our "good" or "bad" behaviour. On its own this may all not be a bad thing if we wish the new reality tunnel to become ours. Many people already set themselves rewards or punishments to help develop the behaviours and thinking that they would like.

Leaders of movements generally are trying to help people become better. Some allow for more movement of development and some are more controlling. For an organisation to grow and thus help more people there needs to be a strong cathedral. This allows for easier transformations, people can easily drop into a new reality tunnel.

These movements can be seriously transformational. Radically re-shifting the castles of multiple people out of the (usually consumer) paradigm they are stuck in. Social cathedrals allow for power from the castles to flow into the cathedral. The teacher that is providing the transformitory cathedral receives power as the creator of the cathedral. And often the power can go to their heads, especially as it is the exercising of power that continues to build the cathedral.

Cathedrals much like castles need to have clear hierarchies if they are going to integrate the chaos around them. Many movements don't have this hierarchy they quickly disperse. On the other hand the world's dominant reality tunnel, consumerism may have become vaster than anyone can control but it is also literally eating itself and will eventually perish.

If you wish to be saved from slavery you will have to annihilate what "must be annihilated". To become the Child again, the creative yes being. William Blake shows us the way:

> "Obey thou the Words of the Inspired Man
> All that can be annihilated must be annihilated
> 
> That the Children of Jerusalem may be saved from slavery
> There is a Negation, & there is a Contrary
> The Negation must be destroyed to redeem the Contraries
> The Negation is the Spectre; the Reasoning Power in Man
> This is a false Body: an Incrustation over my Immortal
> Spirit; a Selfhood, which must be put off & annihilated alway
> To cleanse the Face of my Spirit by Self-examination.
> 
> To bathe in the Waters of Life; to wash off the Not Human
> I come in Self-annihilation & the grandeur of Inspiration
> To cast off Rational Demonstration by Faith in the Saviour
> To cast off the rotten rags of Memory by Inspiration
> To cast off Bacon, Locke & Newton from Albions covering
> To take off his filthy garments, & clothe him with Imagination
> To cast aside from Poetry, all that is not Inspiration"

## Chaos vs order

*(Growing and dying; show how the creative leads to synthesis, and the tyrant to stagnancy.)*

*(mostly in this section we are talking about shared structures / cathedrals. cathedrals are also talked about in the last section)*

Castles are structured to contain the chaos that they encounter.

Castles wish to continue growing and building themselves. We can further define that the order of the castle may be dynamic quality orientated. Or it may be quantity orientated. Quantity orientated can become tyrannical in its self-replication, whereas quality orientated is creative and more open to restructuring. Quantity increases the reach of possible actions and quality increases the set of known actions.

|  | **Quantity** (increases Possibilities) |  |
|---|---|---|
|  | **Dis-ordered** | **Ordered** |
| **Quality** (Increases known actions) | **Un-chaotic** | Zombie | Tyrant |
|  | **Chaotic** | Punk | Creative |

Punk and zombie configurations present no challenge to the tyrant and the creative. It is the Tyrant and the creative structure that is in an endless battle. They are the two great forces that reach for freedom: Creative order and pathological order.

This is a dynamic within each of us but it also plays out in ideology and social dynamics. There is a pendulum that swings between the two over history.

Alexander the great conquered half the world as did the Persian Empire before him, the bloody and power hungry nations unified many countries. Eventually leading to great growth in the sharing of knowledge as seen in the library of Alexandria. Tyrannical order gave way to a creative one.

Existence appears to have a self-righting mechanism. However, many front-on attempts to confront tyranny (or pathological order) in the pursuit of freedom only result in another tyranny. Pushing this to the extreme we can consider the motives of the Nazis in the Second World War. Out of an impulse to remove the tyranny of debt, Nazi Germany arose (a simplification I know). Anti-Semitism is misplaced anti-banking and debt trading, the real problem is the way banks control ever more of the people's assets. Out of an impulse for freedom for Germany came pathological acts of control and ordering.

The invisibles is a comic book created by Grant Morrison. There are many planes of reality simultaneously existing together. Magic, aliens, time travel, soul travel, gods, angels, psychics, robots etc etc. the landscape that the characters swim in is constantly changing. All that stays the same is the two forces that are battling each other, one of pathological order and one of freedom. Both sides use any technology or magic they can. The invisibles are an eclectic mix of individuals with various abilities operating mostly with their own volition and ideas. The invisibles are battling against interdimensional alien gods that have a hierarchical system of control and have already enslaved most of the human race without their knowledge. Grant Morrison created three volumes of this comic as a super sigil to help wake up and save humanity from the forces of domination.

[Images: Pages from Morrison, Grant, et al. The Invisibles. DC Comics, 1996.]

For some reason there is an intersection between major contemporary wizards and comic book creators. Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, and Jodorowski all openly profess their love and use of magic. After the tragedy of dune Jodorowski began to create comic books, he could move even faster and further through ideas, as the artist would only be limited by their pen rather than costly movie production. With Jean Giraud drawing he created the Incal, an epic multiplanetary - multi-dimensional space opera. Themes include spiritual transformation, eternal return, mystical symbolism and Tarot. And the battle continues between "uniformity and diversity" or pathological order and freedom

[Images: Pages from Jodorowsky, Alejandro, and Moebius. The Incal. Epic Comics, 1988]

These examples of science fiction are indicative of an eternal struggle between pathological and creative freedom. The protagonists and to a greater extent the authors live in a way that is "excellent", increasing freedom and the expansion of consciousness through imagination. The more links they or we can integrate, the further one can expand, in a sea of consciousness that is without bounds, breaking out of any reality tunnel or matrix that is restricting one.

If existence is pure consciousness, with stories embedded in myths embedded in stories, then life becomes a kind of game. The universe and imagination spontaneously erupt infinitely, let's embrace this life with joy: "party on dudes"

## Navigation

*(there seemed to be a lot of double ups between how to navigate and how to structure, so i combined them but there may be some sorting to do or re-wording or structuring of the sections. at the moment i tried to go through the titles of the next sections and label them: Castles of individual freedom =structuring - Navigating the ground of being =navigation)*

We have already touched on the primacy of the imagination, if imagination is the basis of reality then anything we can think is real. So then how do we navigate it? Given the apparent lack of transcendental signifieds, can we say that true and false exist?

How do we navigate this realm?

some suggestions from the past have been Beauty, humanity, wisdom producing

In contemplating our place in time and the evolution of consciousness, we find ourselves on the precipice of profound transformation. Humanity is transitioning into what can be described as post-history —a phase where post-rational consciousness takes root. This shift, described by thinkers like Owen Barfield as "final participation" and Alan Moore as a reawakening of magic, is coupled with the increasing hallucination of connective technology, as noted by Terence McKenna. The crucial step ahead is the re-embodiment of mind into matter, where multiple paradigms converge into a graspable, integrated whole. *(this is explaining a mixture of things the future form of the magician along with an astral/etheric castle of unified complexity.)*

*(pasted) The Deepest foundation sits outside of time and space. It is a gravitational anchor of love and beauty for the castle. It is the embodiment of Christ; it is the overman as the meaning of the earth. It will be our map, a picture of the path of initiation, and the philosophers' stone. Once we become aware of the forces that give our castle structure we can amplify them and increase the dynamic growth of our castle.*

We begin as a child. And the child calls us to join them in the future. To know is to love. The expansion of consciousness is an act of love. A baby/child is full of this love, they send out all their impulses and see what they receive.

## Active imagination

*(as i am using active imagination as the sole method for navigation, it might be good to divide out how this may happen at different levels of consciousness. as it can be more dreamlike or more rational. and I'm not sure whether to separate these out or have them all in the same order. or perhaps I have done the wrong thing by combining navigation and structuring for freedom.)*

In the end the best form of navigation is to accept that anything can be real to the extent that it develops its unified complexity, and we can develop any imaginary idea or avatar through visionary imagination.

Active Imagination is a technique we may use as the wizard to summon avatars into the castle, to make them living, and to integrate them into the structure of the castle. Jung coined the term Active imagination, which defines itself in opposition to passive imagination, such as dreams or simply daytime reveries of various sorts. Being active means participating in the imaginative realm *(sounds also like lucid dreaming?)*. Thus forming a link between the conscious and the subconscious mind. It is worth noting that the term unconscious is misleading. Jung believed that our dream life always exists in every moment, however the part of us that is self-reflective is not always in communication with this part of ourselves. Bernardo Kastrup points to multiple personality disorders, and the evidence that alters are conscious even when they are not in the driver seat. Donald Hoffman also uses the knowledge provided by split brain experiments carried out in epileptic patients: in an effort to restrict the seizure spreading from one side of the brain to the other the corpus callosum is cut, this helped the patients with their seizure, however it also demonstrated through further experiments that both halves of the brain were conscious, they could hold differing religious views and could function independently. I bring up these examples as evidence that there are most likely parts of our mind that aren't in the spotlight of our neocortex or our rational reflective mind. But are nonetheless conscious. Thus when I unavoidably use the term unconscious, I am referring to those parts of our larger self that have not been in the spotlight of the small self, our construction of ourselves as a separate being.

Our fairly narrow and perhaps fragile self-image that locates ourselves as an individual, and allows us the necessities of clock time and bodily boundary only occupies a tiny epicentre of our possible larger self. If we can move outwards we can meet the alters that live with us in the metabolism of our body. Physically these include our stomach mind, our heart, our mammalian brain and our reptilian brain. Psychologically this includes our unconscious. As we reach further out we encounter other humans that we can only communicate over a limited bandwidth. In the interior realm we can also reach further into imaginative worlds and encounters with other beings and gods. Various parts of our higher self reside in a scale of connection with the infinite consciousness of the universe.

The first step of active imagination is to accept imagination as real, at least as much as the exterior world is real. If we can do this, we allow ourselves the impetus to be active participants in the world of the imagination, which beckons to us when given the status of ontological primitive. With the will to participate we then need to allow the obfuscated mind to reveal itself. Our everyday existence is mostly made up of a chattering monkey mind, which we can visualise as ourselves in a large castle shining a bright torch on a manikin that stands before us. This manikin is the false self. It is a zombie avatar that we sleepily accept as our real self. We are shining this torch so brightly at the zombie avatar that our eyes are blinded to the large hall around us. The tapestries, paintings, bookshelves and curiosities of our unconscious are all shrouded in darkness, our eyes cannot adjust to them.

We let go of the small self and look into infinity. We want to leave behind the chit chat of our small mind. And as we move our awareness out into the infinite we still want to remain conscious. We want to remain as the witness. This is the process of evolution. We are adding another dimension. If a dot is stretching along a Y-axis it is drawing a line. If it stretches along an x-axis it draws a line in another direction. But if it does both simultaneously it makes a plain. That is what we need to do with our thinking, feeling and willing. With our rationality and intuition.

### Move away from your small self (navigation)

We need to destroy the zombie avatar. We may need to occupy, annihilate, or subdue our small self, through repetitive activity, pushing ourselves to our limits and meditation respectively. Occupy by tasks such as dancing, writing or painting. "An indirect approach, which often reveals the unconscious particularly well, is to write stories, also about other people. Such stories reveal to the narrator the soul parts of which he is completely unconscious." Annihilate through breath work and various forms of visionquest or psychedelics, which takes us out of our body and our small self. Subdue through meditation. Coleridge inhibited his monkey mind with opium. Julia Cameron uses morning pages to cognise and clear her chitter chatter. Many artists find music helps them. Others enter a hypnagogic state pre or post sleep. Beyond these techniques we may simply be able to shine our torch away from the Zombie avatar and towards the wall, the simple turning of the torch becomes increasingly easier after we have destroyed the false self a few times. And yes, I'll have you know that the zombie avatar often reforms instantaneously so it's an ongoing distraction for all of us that function in the physical world.

### To look into infinite being (navigation)

This is the other side of the coin from the last step. so it happens simultaneously. Salvador Dali had several methods of entering a hypnagogic state in which he could look into infinite being. He recommends planting olive trees around the house so that the leaves may create a soup of flickering, which may seduce your eyes in vision into reverie. He also recommended spending hours with a blank white canvas at dusk. Leonardo Da Vinci similarly recommended looking into splashes of mud in order that visions might be generated: "By indistinct things the mind is stimulated to new inventions". Day and night dreams are also fundamental hypnagogic states which Tolkien and Jung are inspired by (see the dark water). Fundamentally we need to open our awareness to the subconscious. "Learn to see or hear the dream while awake" One approach is image streaming, or one can take on more solid forms in order to limit the shape shifting. Or also to allow the subconscious to enter through the hands etc. There are a few methods I use for visioning. Open-ended modes include White noise and the Ganzfeld effect, or use Wim Hof breathing. Or by simply watching my third eye and my inner stream. If I am trying to be more specific I will try to direct my imagination, with a particular scene in mind.

---

### Curiosity (navigation)

The next step is to begin a dialogue. Would you like to speak first? You can, however a dialogue can start from any side. Let's say you happen to shine your light on the old man of the sea, who is probably loitering somewhere in the room. The problem is as soon as you shine your light on him he will shift "into a bearded lion and then into a snake and after that a panther and a giant boar. He changed into running water too and a great tree with many leaves." however you must always remember that he is the old man of the sea and keep your light on him. The unconscious or infinite being has made the first move in the dialogue by revealing to you the old man. If you are to keep the dialogue going which is the purpose of active imagination (and the purpose of life) you need to ask a question. In this case we could simply ask "what do you have to tell me old man?". And we must remember this question through the morphing image stream. Otherwise we may lose our reflective self, and the dialogue will be a monologue again. Like Parsifal we must ask the question in order to save the land:

> Although, to a certain extent, he looks on from outside, impartially, he is also an acting and suffering figure in the drama of the psyche. This recognition is absolutely necessary and marks an important advance. So long as he simply looks at the pictures he is like the foolish Parsifal, who forgot to ask the vital question because he was not aware of his own participation in the action. But if you recognize your own involvement you yourself must enter into the process with your personal reactions, just as if you were one of the fantasy figures, or rather, as if the drama being enacted before your eyes were real. — Jung

The reality of the imagination is complete in itself. We should not interpret it with any theory. Take the reality of the Imaginal realm as it is, and question the various forces so that they may respond.

### Embody (navigation and structuring)

Another method of holding on to forms produced by infinite consciousness is through creating things. "the picture must be protected from sinking back into the unconscious, be it by drawing, painting or writing down what one has heard or seen."

Part of our trouble stems from the fact that we are encountering another dimension. "We are only aware of three dimensions, while the figures of the unconscious approach us from an unknown fourth dimension." This is perhaps the reason why a) we find it hard to see the unconscious realm, i.e. it often appears as a stream of imagery when we are trying to look at one thing. And b) why the logic must be interpreted according to its own rules. It exists in another dimension, where time and space are irrelevant.

Something about trying to record our vision will often help to discover it further. In a Heideggerian world disclosure that brings the vision or avatar into a physical space, and starts the process of embodiment.

### Embodied (structuring)

*(Enlivening) (is this a recapitulation of visualising our own structure? or is it something more?)*

A healthy castle is always growing and integrating structure. It is moving towards its potential. Buckminster Fuller (Bucky) used universal design principles in all his inventions and projects, and they are of great benefit when applied to the construction of our ontological castle. Bucky always strove for maximum dynamic tension. I.e. a Dymaxium structure. He made a dymaxium car, a dymaxium house and a dymaxium bathroom and many other designs. This meant using materials to their maximum advantage. Geodesic domes are an example of limited materials being held in a dynamic tension that unlocks their structural power. If we were to construct a Dymaxium ontological castle, how could concepts and paradigms be organised, so that they were maximally efficient, for their tensile strength. In other words, what is the perfect form of the castle?

The main function of the castle is to continue to grow, it must be ordered so that it can most efficiently eat any chaos into its body. Its wizard must be awake and conscious of their own thoughts. A growing castle is childlike, playful and creative. It delineates a structure that contains many lenses, like the kabbalistic tree of life that integrates any concepts it comes in contact with. Many masterminds create a spatial structure in their mind in order to remember more things. If we create spatial structures we can organize and integrate more paradigms and truths. Although the kabbalah, and its ten dimensions of experience, may very well be the perfect knowledge structure, it may not be comprehensible to us. The best knowledge structure is the one we comprehend and can embody. And the strongest truest embodiment takes place when you do the work and create it yourself.

The fool that persists in their folly becomes wise. The fool is the one that remains an amateur; they are without fear of not looking professional. Their learning comes through doing for joy. Rather than doing it right.

We all structure our own reality; our own tree of ontology.

To understand how a castle or ontology tree works we must see that it doesn't describe a purely physical path. Rather each sphere is another dimension that could contain the whole. But they are laid out in this linear journey in order that it may be 'graspable' to the human mind. Our minds seem to remember things best in a 3d space, much like we are used to navigating with our physical body. The world's best masterminds all use memory palaces for this reason. Therefore the Kabbalah tree is seen as a path. As although each can hold all, they are best structured as something graspable.

It's all so simple. And the castle itself finally becomes graspable again. Even though the paradigms are localised, they are known to be simultaneously enfolding. But this can simply be added to them as a translated attribute. Enfolding can be a room or a point on the compass. *(is this clear enough for the reader?)*

So when it comes down to it the castle must become graspable again.

What is a graspable structure? This is left to each person as they structure their castle. Many people live in a castle that is ungraspable and dis-embodied.

We all have different structures that are particularly relatable for us. We return home to these structures much like the memory palace, which is often the childhood home. For many indigenous peoples the land itself embodies their ontology, as it is their home.

Contemporary ontologies have become so disembodied and we have so many stray paradigms. So it's going to take some serious embodying to integrate them.

The Dymaxium castle is not only embodied as a home or palace. But there is also a clear path through it, like a hero's journey. It can be the road there and back again, in which there is a recapitulation.

It is a storyline. Not a story space.

Here is an example of a personal tree of life:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCERFR4WfPk

A similar structure to the tree of life is the human body. Steiner formed Anthroposophy that uses the human as the cipher of the universe. "If we carry... the presence of Christ ...into the whole physical world of man, then in our vision of nature everything comes alive".

*(we have been talking about structuring, but Embodied can also be used as a navigational tool.)*

A similar structure to the tree of life is the human body. Steiner formed Anthroposophy that uses the human as the cipher of the universe. "If we carry... the presence of Christ ...into the whole physical world of man, then in our vision of nature everything comes alive".

The earth itself is a literal and spiritual gravitator for the castle. The earth is transformed by the crucifixion of Christ (research Steiner). For Nietzsche we must remain faithful to the earth: the overman is awake, the overman "is the meaning of the earth". Not a sleeping follower: "believing those who speak of "otherworldly hopes".

Steiner affirms this: we must meditate with our feet on the ground. The physical material of the earthly realm is obviously a major makeup of our place in the realms of body, soul and spirit. We are here to work with the earth. Extrusion = physicalisation = incarnation is the whole reason we are here.

### Love (navigation)

A danger of active imagination is falling into the abyss. "'The method is not entirely without danger, because it may carry the patient too far away from reality" "Danger arises whenever the narrowly delimited, but intensely clear, individual consciousness meets the immense expansion of the collective unconscious, because the latter has a definitely disintegrating effect on consciousness." We may lose touch with the outside world or become trapped in a malevolent loop. There is a single fix for both these problems, love. Love for beings in the finite world keeps us in touch, and love for beings in the infinite world transforms malevolence, revealing and connecting us with truth, and eventually consuming the once malevolent being into the higher self. In terms of connection to finite beings Jung pointed out that the difference between his journey writing the Red Book and Nietzsche writing Zarathustra was that he had children and a family whereas Nietzsche was blown about like a leaf in the wind because he had no roots.

In addition to staying grounded with our physical loved ones we also need to take love with us on our journey into the depths of the psychic realm. Love every being you find. Love all beings that you experience. Especially the ones you are repelled or scared by. Love conquers all, and allows shadows to integrate rather than fracture and become 'radicalised'. Everything has something to reveal to you and to add to your castle.

*(integrate the following)*

Schwaller de Lubicz suggests we can navigate the Imaginal realm by using the intelligence of the heart

> "Awakening is the awakening of the intelligence-of-the-heart... If we give it preponderance over cerebral intelligence, over the mental, it will tell us everything, for it is the intelligence of the universe."

Lubicz identifies that existence is far wider than me comprehended with our rationality. And that our feeling realm can reach wider and encompass more.

Gurdjieff and Ouspensky call us to try and move beyond our primary imagination or our reality tunnel of Maya that we are sleep walking in. We may wake up by deliberate exercises in self-remembering that produce strange intensities of feeling.

---

### Beauty (structuring, or navigating the understanding of your own structure)

**Beauty = unified chaos**

McKenna makes the point that we can no longer point to what is true anymore, nor what is good/moral. But he believes we still know what is beautiful, and that we can use beauty as a gauge to evaluate truth. So if an idea is beautiful it is probably true. Beauty in this sense is probably closer to a Kantian notion, an aesthetic experience capable of generating criticality, rather than beauty as prettiness. Beauty will be a forever-unachievable goal that our castle will constantly gravitate towards. Beauty is everywhere and in everything, there is a bible story where Christ looks at the dead dog that people are deriding, and turns their attention to the beautiful white teeth the dog has. Rudolf Steiner in his book *How to know higher worlds*, says that the path to initiation and gnosis, is to find the good in everyone we meet or situation we find ourselves in, that way we'll always be learning, and taking on images that we find the beauty in through a diverse range of realms. This extended form of beauty is encapsulated by the term Wabi-sabi from Japan, meaning the beauty of imperfection, which although paradoxical is a simple reminder that although something is imperfect on one level it can be perfect on another. Wabi-sabi reminds us of a higher order.

A beautiful idea is one that is living; it has the ability to speak to the soul and to enliven the castle. We will see that they are beautiful and flowering. We shall know them by their fruits! Corbin suggests as much, true imagination will produce knowledge and wisdom.

> "Corbin was aware of the question… of how inner voyagers, travellers in the imaginal, can navigate among the rocks and the shallows of fantasy and on to the wider waters of true imagination"

Henry Corbin takes a more pragmatic route. We need to 'protect imagination… from reckless wastage' only continuing to pursue things that "lead to inner intelligence". True imagination is knowledge and wisdom producing; it is Mind revealing itself. It is part of "a plurality of universes arranged in ascending order". In this sense we can navigate any imagination as long as we have developed a kabbalist castle capable of integration.

Erich Kahler would call this Wholeness. Imagination is navigated by re-integrating and making whole and thus forming wisdom: "Whenever new spheres, new depths of existence are disclosed by a thrust into the unknown, these experiences will have to be integrated into a further complete whole [a] broader, more comprehensive, perfection of form… again and again the wholeness of existence must be re-established. a new wider and more complex wholeness must be apprehended'.

---

### Detachment (navigation)

*(this is a recapitulation of moving away from small self, it is a footnote to love)*

After radical love we must add radical detachment. We must regard all of experience both inward and outward as a myth. This gives us a profound grasp on the true nature of reality. Can you hold the void? "Emptiness" is the magic word that names the essence of the universe; again, as in many magical traditions, to name a thing by its true name—the secret essence of the thing—is to own it, and to understand how public reality evolves from Emptiness into awareness or perception is to be free of its bonds of ordinary causality, to be free, in Buddhist terms, of "being." If we understand that every reality is a myth, then we have greater power.

## Active imagination case studies

### Julie Heffernan

Julie Heffernan is a contemporary practitioner of active imagination. She doesn't directly use the phrase active imagination, but she does talk of her discovery and subsequent use of image streaming. Her image streaming forms one side of an active imagination dialogue that makes up her practice. Each vision (old man of the sea) is captured and put down on the canvas then she listens to her dream self to tell her what the next step is. Sometimes she will begin with a mechanised reproduction of an image idea, however the construction of this image becomes a "frottage" onto which she may search out dreams.

She describes first discovering the technique in a hypnagogic state following a long day of painting: "I was painting for twelve hours a day….exhausted, I shut my eyes and went into a relaxed state. Suddenly I started to see pictures pouring into my head." she had discovered another world that benefited her practice immensely. Eventually, she moved on from her initial unplanned technique of exhaustion, and now simply begins the painting with a first layer of paint, which she now has the ability to feed to her subconscious and allow for a response. Her method is to continue the dialogue between the created image and her inner image stream. "It's really fun to paint this way. A lot of people start with a drawing but I think it kills the process. Each character walks on into my conscious mind" giving the character the stream into her agency allows them to come to life, and thus she is able to begin a dialogue with them.

[Image: Self-Portrait as Great Acceleration, 2016, Oil on canvas, 170.2 × 152.4 cm, Julie Heffernan]

Active imagination facilitates the union of opposites. This brings about peace on earth. Our environment will respond in kind to our vibration. Once we unify our opposites, the conscious and the unconscious, the mycelium and the mushroom, our reality will become heaven on earth.

Successfully surrealism applies active imagination to the imaginal realm.

Heffernan is very aware that she wants to also construct the painting spatially. She has a discipline that is able to hold her visions. She is a successful surrealist, and that is not a title that can be applied often, since its inception those designated as surrealists have mostly failed either not really finding the limitless nature of the imagination or more likely not finding a discipline that will balance their dreams and allow a dialogue. A main problem with surrealism is the falling into stereotypes. This comes about by imposing theories such as Freudian analysis on the vision and directing it according to that logic. The reality of the imagination is complete in itself. We should not interpret it with any theory. Take the reality of the Imaginal realm as it is, and question the various forces so that they may respond. Max Ernst was semi successful in escaping this trap through his use of frottage, which often allowed for a break away from Freudian setups, I believe he genuinely allowed the other dimension to enter in this way.

[Image: The Fireside Angel, 1937, Max Ernst, Oil on canvas]

[Image: Europe After the Rain II, 1940-1942, Max Ernst, Oil on canvas]

Dreams exist in a different realm of logic. if we can enter into this logic, and accept it as real. Further truths may unfold to us. To use active imagination we have to accept unconscious dreams as just as real as the outer world.

Conversely we can attack surrealism from the other side, not only must the public and private be just as real, but they must be seen as the same substance. Furthermore this substance must be seen as smoke and mirrors, or Maya. A similar sentiment is shown in the work of Jung. He says to accept the imaginary as just as real but then to see through the visions as Maya. And ergo see through the exterior world as Maya.

### Alchemy (Example of active imagination)

*(different to navigation but similar to making a fantasy into true imagination. it is an apollonian navigation.)*

*(Alchemy and simultaneous contrast are both still active imagination. when they pick something that isn't currently joined conceptually they are breaking the small self. and then they look to re-embody and make beautiful.)*

*(The following paragraph on holograms might introduce this section?) At the outset we can say that nothing is off limits to the imagination. It is completely up to the individual where they would focus their beam of attention as whichever part we perceive, we see an image of the whole. David Bohm and Leonard Susskind suggest a theory that everything we experience in the universe as 3d reality is a projection from a 2d surface at the edge of the universe. Much like the predicted information that is contained on the horizon of the black hole. However I am pushing their metaphor further, as a major characteristic of Holograms is that if they are cut in half both halves will still produce a full image but at a lower resolution. All we lose as we look at smaller and smaller parts is the degree of resolution. If we join holographic fragments together we generate further resolution and an expansion of consciousness.*

One of the lenses for the development of the castle is Alchemy, a practice of participation between matter and thought. Which is intimately linked to Gnosticism, Shamanism, Witchcraft, Magic, and other Occult practices. The oldest of these is shamanism, which views animals as having spirits; it is animistic, and sometimes this animism is extended to plants and all matter, giving all of nature an agency. As we move back in time the disciplines become more and more unified, science philosophy, art magic and medicine all combine under Alchemy and shamanism.

Gnosticism by contrast is relatively more separated from science, and concerned mainly with divine knowledge, associated with God and the bible including apocryphal texts. Alchemy remains concerned with physical matter and science relatively late in the game, well into the rational age in the western world; the alchemist is a philosophical protagonist (it's a sort of gentleman's shamanism, hehe). It could very much be seen as Barfield's Final Participation.

We can look for parallels in the work of Goethean science as developed by Steiner, to shine a light on what this tradition might look like. And we can look to McKenna for a contemporary lens on practicing alchemy. These ideas can be seen in Fictocriticism, which places the subjective experience of the anthropologist or essayist as central, generating imaginings and images of subjects, as a way of understanding.

It's very strange that in primary and high school we are taught to write an essay as a repetitive statement, the introduction, main body and conclusion must all repeat themselves, and we are given this image as the only essay form. Looking back at the origin of the essay Montaigne would write an essay that wandered and roamed, moving from observations of society, to philosophical musings, and ponderings of his daily bodily functions; in final participation even excrement is uplifted. Montaigne's writings are an example of integrating the bodily and the experiential, with the philosophical. The human is at the heart of experience.

Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy roughly translates to Knowledge of the nature of man. Anthroposophy's scope encompasses all existence, and so we see that it is the study of the human in all things. Before publishing esoteric theosophical and Anthroposophical writings, Steiner was asked to edit Goethe's writings on Nature. Steiner was inspired by Goethe's way of thinking, viewing it as a solution to the problems he found reading contemporary philosophy, particularly the epistemological problems generated by Kant. He wrote his first book *The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception*, and this was to become a foundation stone for his spiritual fields of enquiry, which he felt Goethe had left the door open to.

Goethe and following him Steiner are making a step towards a re-unifying Final participation, in 1921 Steiner gave a lecture saying: People think of natural phenomena so entirely apart from man that they are tending ever more and more to disregard the human being in their study of the phenomena of Nature. He, on the contrary, believed that natural phenomena only reveal their true meaning if they are regarded in full connection with man — with the whole organization of man. In saying this, Goethe pointed to a method of research, which is well nigh anathematized nowadays. People today seek an 'objective' understanding of Nature through research that is completely separated from the human being. This is particularly noticeable in such a science as Astronomy, where no account at all is taken of the human being.

For Goethe knowledge was about association, rather than separation, dare we say Hallucinogenic? (Psychedelic experience is commonly reported to increase meaningfulness and connection between all things.) Certainly rejecting the Cartesian-Newtonian method's inherent split of observer and observed. Goethe wanted a living interaction with nature, the task of the scientist was to enter into the living essence of the plant and discover its "Ur-phenomena" its underlying archetypal pattern, which is something he saw as clearly objective and not subjective. Often these Ur-phenomena are best discovered through a comparison and an energised linking of diverse phenomena, to bridge diversity forms and activities we use morphology. This can be applied between species or simply to the movement within a single animal plant or organism. We often get to Ur-phenomena through observation of the movement between states.

Morphology can be found in many scientific breakthroughs along with Goethe's. When Newton saw the apple fall and then looked at the moon and asked why it didn't appear to be falling or if perhaps it was also falling. He was trying to discover an essence that both these objects held, and how this essence might be morphed through changes in density etc. In other words the essence of morphology is unity. Other discoveries morph diverse phenomena, such as the electromagnetic-force connecting magnetism and electricity, or the unification of space-time under general relativity. String theory is a unified theory (all theories are unifying but none have gotten as far as this), which attempts to find an underlying force that may morph into the other forces (electro-magnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and gravity). Goethean science is said to go beyond straight science by being participatory and imaginative as opposed to dissociative and separate. By bringing the being in the world nature of the observer into the equation.

Steiner had a lot of fun pushing this imaginative science to its limits: We would feel sick and unhealthy if we were to approach nature, looking up into the world of stars, with only the calculating vision of the astronomers, and if we then allowed these dead thoughts to sink into the world; we would feel sick and the sickness would be unto death. But if we let Christ accompany us, if we carry our dead thoughts in the presence of Christ into the world of stars, into the world of the sun, of the moon, of the clouds, mountains, rivers, minerals, plants, and animals, into the whole physical world of man, then in our vision of nature everything comes alive… The entire earth becomes a kind of "book of life" that enlightens us about the human world, the world in which we live, the world of human souls.

We have to find living as opposed to dead images, ones that can give a conceptual and emotional force to the movements of the galaxy, the arteries, and the nervous system. Steiner brings Christ into it as an image representing the human. For Steiner the incarnation of Christ was a pivot point in the evolution of consciousness, signalling the ego or the "I" entering into the human, which is the meaning of the earth, "the world of human souls". So Christ in this sense is an archetypal image of the human at our current stage of evolution.

In Jeffrey Jerome Cohen's book *Stone*, he argues against anthropocentrism. Cohen takes up the mantle of the earth, and imbues it once more with agency. He joins a growing number of ecologists that believe anthropocentrism is disastrous, and suggests that if we could shift our understanding to the geographical time of stones and mountains, we can escape our separation from the environment, and our exploitation of the earth. However, I would argue that anthropocentrism is unavoidable, it is a necessary part of thought as humans; we are and always will be at the centre of our thoughts, what is more we are our thoughts in as much as we are a conscious ego. And if we are to say that anthropocentrism is simply a matter of the human body as valued above all else, then true anthropocentrism would take tremendous care of the environment as a necessary platform that holds up human life. I think a better future doesn't lie in escaping the human, it lies in extending the human, as far as we can push it, into animals, plants, and rocks, into molecules. Anthropomorphism is an extension of thought and ego into the very earth. It has only been during a relatively narrow period of human history that we have relegated our consciousness to our body, to our brain. Transcendence has been sacrificed for Immanence

### Simultaneous contrast (Example of active imagination)

*(really the same as alchemy in my view so maybe join)*

> "The opposite of a fact is falsehood, but the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth." — Niels Bohr

Simultaneous contrast would have to be a gravitator for the castle, a truth is never content to be left standing on its own with no opposition to keep it healthy. Roland Barthes' Punctum, Gristle for the mill and so forth.

*(this whole paragraph seems different to simultaneous contrast. it is more like "strangeness". it is something which is un-readable. not just contradictory.)* The best thought images are often created through a juxtaposition of incongruences; interpreters of the surrealists are generally too eager to relegate imagery to Freudian symbols, or symbolic stories ("NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT THINKING; YOU'RE JUST BEING LOGICAL." Bohr), whereas a truly energized surrealist painting could not be compartmentalized in this way. In my own paintings I would like a continual bubbling up; for a conceptual binaural beat to occur. Symbolist art is also a tremendous attraction, but it is successful not through surface symbols, but through an insistence on deeper symbols, and an invitation to the viewer to keep on looking in the hope they might get somewhere. A deep symbol is a thought form. A thought form is often a hallucinogenic structure that is visual, we cannot read it per se, we rather know from it, it speaks to us but not as a voice. Here is an example of an experience I had: After reading and studying the apocalypse according to St. John it was getting quite late so I went to bed, I closed my eyes and tried to shift towards an imaginative state to call forth sleep. As I did so I saw pulsating forms and patterns, and I knew that these were visions of the text I had been reading, strange alien choreographies and Escher-esque morphing forms. This was a vision of the astral world, in which an alchemical force was shaping new forms for me, so that they might produce the music necessary for my etheric body.

Terrence McKenna identifies strongly with Alchemy. He talks about its characteristics as alchemical/mercury thought and the union of opposites, the search for the philosopher's stone; the universal panacea, and the spiritual self-transformational process that is a dual aspect of creating the philosopher's stone. McKenna sees the first through to the fourth century, as similar to our own, in that there is an atmosphere of despair and exhaustion. It was during this time that the Hermetic Corpus was developed: "[The] Hermetic Corpus is the most poetic and cleanly expressed outpouring of ancient knowledge that we possess…it is essentially a religion of the redemption of the earth through magic." In Alchemy this is achieved through a series of processes, this is called The Great Work, where substance is taken and refined, through calcination, dissolution, separation, conjunction, fermentation, distillation and coagulation. The alchemic substance being transformed is at once physical and spiritual, so that the great work is a transformation of ourselves. To be an alchemist is a dreamlike matter, we must take on alchemical thinking, we must embody mercury, that metal which can flow freely and take on the form of any vessel, mirroring the situation that it finds itself in through its liquid metal surface. Mercury flows like the droplet of the yin yang, and it is S shaped surface between the yin and yang that is the most important aspect to understand; in this instance mercury is the flowing boundary between waking and sleeping "where you can project the contents of the unconscious and you can read it back to yourself". Alchemy, like hermeneutics as above so below, gives us a picture of the human in the microcosm and the macrocosm. But furthermore it contains its own antipathy "alchemical thinking is thinking that is always antithetical", it forms a union of opposites, like the archetypal hermaphrodite, between masculine and feminine, soul and Luna, Mercury and Sulphur. This antithetical thinking sits at the outskirts of rational thought: it is pre-rational and post-rational. To reach it we must move into dreams and thought-images that may carry us beyond 1 = 1.

*(this whole last paragraph is unclear.)*

### Unification

*(combine this section with alchemy and simultaneous contrast. as an ending)*

Coleridge navigates the mindscape by differentiating between primary imagination, secondary imagination and fantasy. Primary imagination is this human experience we are having, that we call existence. secondary imagination.

> "The primary imagination I hold to be the living power and prime agent of all human perception, and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite 'I am'. The secondary I consider as an echo of the former, co-existing with the conscious will, yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency, and differing only in degree and in the mode of its operation. It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate; or where this process is rendered impossible, yet still, at all events, it struggles to idealize and to unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead'

So coleridge says we should navigate by idealising and unifying, in an essentially vital process.

### The Dark Water (tolkien case study)

Tolkien's *Hobbit*, *The Lord of the Rings* and the *Silmarillion* are three of his major books that all depict Middle Earth. Within this realm there is a book that is written by Bilbo and Frodo, they record their adventures and history (Hobbit and LoTR), and Bilbo also translates Elvish History (Silmarillion). This book is called the Red Book of Westmarch. And Tolkien's books are all translations of this Red Book. It Just so happens that the periods of Tolkien and Jung's Red Books line up. In 1913 they both began their visionary/imaginary experiences. Without knowledge of each other's work they both developed a Red book with profound similarities. The heart of the hobbit could be said to be Bilbo's Descent into the caves of the misty mountains, where he comes to an underground lake and finds the ring on a rock. Jung's initial embrace of his visions brought on a similar descent into an underground chamber in which he also finds a jewel.

Furthermore Jung and Tolkien both have visions of floods. Jung's vision of a wave of blood engulfing Europe came to him in 1913, and Tolkien had recurring dreams of apocalyptic floods from early childhood. For Tolkien these dreams were Atlantean, and he brought them into middle earth under the name Numenor. After Numenor sinks back down into the sea a colony is created in Gondor, much like the stories of Egypt as a remnant from atlantis. Tolkien also wrote two more science fiction books. *The Lost Road* and the *Notion Club Papers*. C S Lewis and Tolkien dared each other to write a time travel novel. Lewis wrote *That Hideous Strength* and Tolkien wrote his unfinished *The Lost Road*. Tolkien then ten years later wrote *The Notion Club Papers* which includes a version of the Inklings in Oxford and even begins with a discussion of "That Hideous Strength". Tolkien's *Notion Club Papers* are a quirky and unconventional masterpiece. The first half of the book is pure literary discussion between the renamed Inklings on the nature of the imaginary. The second half moves into more plot drawing on reincarnating individuals from Atlantis that show up at different points in history along with dreams and astral travel in which a few of the characters move through time and space and even into other "dimensions" such as the mythic dimension. Tolkien here was attempting to weave together many reverberations of the myth of Atlantis. However as fate would have it Tolkien's Publisher Stanley Unwin insisted that Tolkien devote his energy to a sequel to the Hobbit instead. In the *Notion club papers* Tolkien imagines a huge storm in 1987, and incredibly there really was a storm in England only a couple of months from when Tolkien had "predicted" it, known as "The Great Storm" it was the largest in 300 years. My Parents and grandparents still remember the devastation, the ancient oak trees that had been torn up by their roots and how people were literally crying for these ancient trees. I'm sure Tolkien would have been crying too.

### Walpurgisnacht

**Rembrandt:** An image is a moment in time. Luminosity is a product of darkness and a strict hierarchy of tonal shifts. All that glitters is not gold. Gold has value from its rarity.

**Constable:** life is fractal; the universe has an infinite number of centres. Every acorn is a gem that may birth a forest. The true human vision isn't a snapshot. It is a wandering and a meandering through time.

**Claude Lorrain:** in order to capture the light we must darken it. Pour mud over it. Without the lens of darkness I am overwhelmed by the light. I am seduced by it and I can no longer seduce. My power is given away in my enjoyment.

**Hockney:** mind shifts between perspectives as it sees fit. Sees fit. The fitness of sight. Healthy sight is one that is free to move in all directions of consciousness. It isn't restricted to a single dimension that might cause tennis elbow or secretarial lower back pain.

**Turner:** The debate comes down to the properties of light. Are you Newtonian or Goethean? Colours arise at the boundary of light and dark. Darkness has its own force and is not simply an absence. it can be an opacity that will shield or reflect. Like the atmosphere that red shifts the sunset. Newton's light is that of the camera. It has only one dimension. Goethe's light and dark embraces the lived experience of light.

**Dali:** light is the point of penetration. The refractions and reflections that enable perception are the crucifixion of Christ. Everything you look at becomes pinned like a butterfly. It is nailed to the cross, it is the sacrifice of incarnation, the crystallisation that makes the individual ego possible and bridles the infinite. To remain with the infinite is where I fall in love. I spend many hours with the white canvas, the field of olive leaves, or the darkness of my bed. And it is at these times that I see Christ as the Child. The infinite is not yet fixed to the cross.

**Michelle Ussher:** mythology is a palette. it runs in rivulets of paint, it can be mixed and daubed with wild abandon. Just as the notes may produce memories and awaken, it may also lullaby. It pays to sleep also. As where has it all come from but darkness? The yellows of the dawn, recapitulate at sunset.

**Ernst Fuchs:** a thousand rubies. a thousand tears. The diamond net wraps us all. And it is with infinite sadness, the joy of the one that is always awake, that the void has been torn asunder. The birth pangs of godhood.

## Immortality

*(transforming our structure, perhaps astral, etheric and physical, so that it serves the magician. and at a certain point we can control re-incarnation etc.)*

*(paste as seems to fit?: Using the Tibetan book of the dead and consciousness building exercises it is possible that a wizard may be able to "live" beyond the death of the physical body and maintain some perspective. The Magician must prepare the castle for submersion if it is his/her wish to maintain their agency. He/she will have to equip the castle with various talismans to hold the castle together as the forces of the great mother (infinite being) surround it.)*

It is possible that we restructure our castle so that it cannot die, so that our ego may continue to live until we are satisfied with our embodiment of infinite being. This is the logical potential of potentiation. We have to create a castle that will not be torn apart by the forces of darkness at death; by the infinite being that is our mother. It is all too easy to let go of our ego and return to unity with source, and this is only desirable for some individuals. So here we are talking about the ego in the Egyptian sense rather than the Buddhist sense. The Egyptian book of the dead reveals how the ego that can be prepared with spells and knowledge of names of beings in the psychic realm in order that it might pass through it and become a god.

The rejection of complete dissolution into infinite being is a negation; we are saying no to something. There are mixed opinions as to whether this is preferable. But some may take the approach that to live fully is to live forever. The Kabbalists see negativity as "the essential manifestation of the primal will". The name for primal will is Keter, it is a "darkness which is at the same time the source of all light." Keter's negativity gives light and existence to all the other sefirot and at the same time it is "delight and desire". It is a primal delight and desire that is at the heart of creation. For the yes of creation to come into being it has to say no. Leading on from this we could see the dissolution of the ego as essentially anti-creation. We have to say no to it if we want creative consciousness to continue.

*(What is the following saying? I don't think it fits in immortality)*

The next important step is to embrace the other. We have to integrate the masculine and the feminine. In other words we must have a strong enough order to hold chaos inside ourselves. Otherwise we will be overwhelmed by exterior chaos. In Blake's *Milton* he outlines the death and void outside of existence that if we enter into will destroy us. Our "Human power" i.e Individual human relationships can sustain contentions and splits but the eroticism of the mind cannot sustain such a split. The split leads to death. Unification of the "six-fold [multiplistic] Miltonic Female" leads to immortality. The separated light of awareness is masculine and the infinite life force is feminine. If we do not integrate this multiplicity then "thou goest to Eternal Death"

Milton paints a scene where the multiplistic feminine principle is first exploded out from ourselves in a diversifying force before being reintegrated with our conscious self. As a "Garment dipped in blood" around the limbs of Jesus. The imagination around the ego.

> the Virgin divided Six-fold & with a shriek
> Dolorous that ran thro all Creation a Double Six-fold Wonder!
> Away from Ololon she divided & fled into the depths
> Of Milton's Shadow as a Dove upon the stormy Sea.
> 
> Then as a Moony Ark Ololon descended to Felphams Vale
> In clouds of blood, in streams of gore, with dreadful thunderings
> Into the Fires of Intellect that rejoiced in Felphams Vale
> Around the Starry Eight: with one accord the Starry Eight became
> One Man Jesus the Saviour. wonderful! round his limbs
> The Clouds of Ololon folded as a Garment dipped in blood
> Written within & without in woven letters: & the Writing
> Is the Divine Revelation in the Literal expression:
> A Garment of War, I heard it named the Woof of Six Thousand Years"

As Jesus wears the cloak of death he is the unification and the redemption of death. Jesus becomes immortal because he has embraced the double six-fold feminine. The "clouds of blood (Ololon), in streams of gore"

To embrace life fully is to accept its physicality in its gory detail. Gore as lust and the sexual unification of flesh in the landscape of embodiment.

> "first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul is to be expunged". 

Know that the masculine is not distinct from the feminine and unify them. "The whole creation will be consumed and appear infinite and holy…by an improvement of sensual enjoyment." We will come back to these ideas in Eroticism / Orgasmysticism.

## Apocalypse

*(The call of the final destination)*

The apocalypse is a force that comes towards us from the future. It is a retroactive force that ripples out from an unknown event of becoming. The event is the full realisation of potential; the idealised castle structure. The event is obfuscated but its effects are visible and felt as a tidal wave.

It is something that calls to us from the future much like aliens. It is a time paradox. (Bill and Ted's excellent adventure) *(Maybe we can talk about the infinite series of apocalypse evolution that end in that place beyond time where we wake up as gods.)*

*(pasted) As the hyperspheric castle inflows and outflows, tidal waves pass it, one after the other over eons. This is a force from the future that is acting on our castle in the present. There is a super tidal wave, on its way through time, growing towards the castle. The waves are sent from the sun, they are also solar flares. The castle simultaneously falls towards these waves, drawn as if towards a black hole. As it falls through each wave the castle is restructured. An image of all previous water is contained in the wave; it is a retroactive force.*

### Tidal wave

> "We can find all the teachings of Theosophy in the Apocalypse" — Steiner

I had a dream of the end of Atlantis, a large sphere descended from the sky, it was simultaneously a comet and also a spaceship designed to destroy the world. We created a technological race and they conspired against us with a few of our own. The perpetrators had an underground Romanesque city to protect them from the apocalypse, connected to the surface by an umbilical cord.

We were all destroyed in seconds, however we escaped death by turning into water. We, the liquid ones, could shape back and forth between water and a more humanistic form. We gathered in small communities on the outskirts of the underground city. I found myself in an ancient courtyard with old trees, surrounded by arches with crumbling bricks.

---

The apocalypse presents us with a series of images. And it is through eating these images and transforming our astral body that we can transform our etheric and physical bodies.

The imagination is a tool of the knowledge seeker. According to Steiner, the images that can be received are not arbitrary. Steiner places imagination as a stepping block to intuition and inspiration. Terrence McKenna builds thought images, through the use of language but nonetheless, images. We see his image of the apocalypse as the transcendental object at the end of time; the singularity that speaks to us and gravitates us towards it.

The apocalypse can almost be seen as a comforting device, placing time within a structure, in a perhaps more graspable paradigm than a continuous infinity. Perhaps this is why it is a recurring symbol in so many cultures. 2012 was regarded as the end date of the 5126 year long Mayan Calendar (Mesoamerican Long Count calendar), and Terrance McKenna joined in on this prediction via his Time wave theory of increasing novelty. The revelation (apocalypse) of St. John is seen by some as a prediction for the future. Some "Hindu cosmologies describe a universe that is cyclical or oscillating and infinite in time. The universe is described as a cosmic egg that cycles between expansion and total collapse. It expanded from a concentrated form — a point called a Bindu. The universe, as a living entity, is bound to the perpetual cycle of birth, death, and rebirth." Theosophy and Anthroposophy also sees a series of worlds and epochs that come to an end, often through cataclysmic events. However these worlds are part of a process over eons of cosmic evolution.

Rudolf Steiner gives us a reading of St. John's Revelation, in his lecture series *Reading the Pictures of the Apocalypse*, as an image of the future of evolution. As well as it being a text of initiation, giving us an image of the structure of the human, as it is and can be. Steiner sees images as appropriate modes for conveying knowledge of higher realms and deeper truths, which often cannot be put into words: "The Apocalypse is a cosmic explanation of the world. The author was an initiate. He spoke of universal laws that apply to the world from the beginning to the decline, from the alpha to the omega."

> "We should allow the holy symbols given in the Apocalypse to work upon us. The sign of the Sun intelligence, for example, should not remain a mere sign for us; we should immerse ourselves in this sign until we feel it is no longer dead but flowing with life. The signs should be for us doors connecting the physical to the spiritual world. Then we have fulfilled our duty: to connect the physical and the spiritual worlds."

For Steiner the human is made up of four bodies, the physical, etheric, astral and spiritual. There is also the bull, the lion, the eagle and the lamb, which correspond to our willing, feeling, thinking, and ego.

> "In the second vision John sees the four apocalyptic living beings…. The fourfold nature of human generic souls is characterized by the four living creatures of the Apocalypse: lion, bull, eagle, and Man. The lower human being is portrayed through these four living creatures, and the lamb symbolized the perfected human being — that is, the fifth living creature."

There are several hierarchies of beings of which humans are the 10th, included above us are all the gods from mythology including Christ and Yahweh but they are one of many. Other hierarchies evolve as well, and lower hierarchies will one day be greater than the higher hierarchies as they have been able to transform lower states of matter into their multifold bodies. Within this context Steiner talks of human evolution, specifically the entrance of the I into the human: "An age began when the secret mysteries became accessible to everyone through the mystery of Golgotha, which was placed in the center of the world. The chosen priests and kings gradually cease to exist. A final state is pointed to wherein everyone is a priest and a king, a state wherein all distinctions are swept away and all human beings are made equal. Therefore, the Apocalypse speaks of: "... a Kingdom, priests to his God and Father." (Rev. 1:6)."

In Steiner's world conception the Christian God isn't worshiped as they don't exist yet, instead this Christian conception of god is seen as something that is at the end point of evolution, and it is sometimes this end point that is referred to when Steiner uses the word god in prayer.

Steiner continues to unpack the Apocalypse of St. John: "Then a number of pictures lead us to the astral plane. We see groups of beings undergoing transformation in the astral light: "... and he who sat there appeared like jasper and carnelian, and, round the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald." (Rev. 4:3) "And before the throne there is as it were a sea of glass, like crystal." (Rev. 4:6) The quality and being of the astral light is indicated by the transparency. In the astral light we can see through objects; they appear like glass. The entire astral world is like a glass sea."

In trying to understand four dimensions. We first would imagine a civilization of flat land in 2 dimensions, anything that lies on the plane around the flatlander obscures their view, however for someone that can see in 3d, such as us, all points, lines and shapes on the 2d plane would be visible. Then we could imagine an alien with 4 dimensional vision (5 including time), they would be able to see through 3d space as we know it, in effect seeing all our organs and bones etc. it would effectively be like a sea of glass. Perhaps moving towards the nagual/astral we may encounter more and more dimensions as we approach the 11 dimensional space of string field theory, where strings vibrate in 11D producing a kind of music that shapes matter. String theory is our best and most comprehensive working theory for how the universe operates, which makes its predictions all the more exciting. Along with multiple universes, String theory predicts the formation of branes (from the word membrane), which have the potential to grow to enormous size, even to the size of the universe. Our universe may then exist on the surface of one of these branes, and the big bang may have happened when another brane collided with ours.

We will look at one more alchemical image from the apocalypse. Via Steiner one last time:

> "The alchemy of the human being is this: what the plants do for us today, human beings in the future will be able to accomplish within and through their consciousness. What is outside the human being today will be intertwined within the physical body when we have taken in the entire plant world, when we have expanded our consciousness to include the entire world of plants. That is the future condition of humanity. Then, what exists outside in the natural world surrounding us will be entirely different.

We will be able to photosynthesize in the future and we will also have a system inside us that will use carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, much like plants do now.

As the cosmic egg cycles between expansion and total collapse we move through cycles of separations and reintegrations or revelations. Synthesis of antithesis takes place as other hierarchies interact with our own: the Christ 'I' synthesizing into our bodies, and the future plants that will live inside us along with the tree of life that is already present in the branches of our blood vessels. We are pulled towards the increasing simultaneity, novelty, and complexity. Through the McKenna Lens: "I think of history as a kind of mass psychedelic experience. The drug is technology, and as technology gets more and more perfected as a mirror of the human mind, the cultural experiences become more and more hallucinatory."

### Solar flare

I felt the tidal wave today, as I was outside weeing on the lemon tree, I closed my eyelids and looked towards the sun. Visions and patterns played across my vision and I knew I was being called through time.

The electromagnetic solar wind reaches out to all beings in the solar system and guides them, like a massive brain sending pulses through its neurons.

An image of the cross is present in many pre-Christian cultures, Steiner believes this is to do with the way the sun and the earth hold us: as we stand on the earth the gravity of the sun pulls us up, while the gravity of the earth pulls us down. The east and west horizons give us the horizontal pole of the cross, this is repeated by Don Juan in *Tales Of Power*: "Do you know that at this very moment you are surrounded by eternity? And do you know that you can use that eternity, if you so desire?"….."There! Eternity is there!" he said, pointing to the horizon. Then he pointed to the zenith. "Or there, or perhaps we can say that eternity is like this." He extended both arms to point to the east and west…"Do you know that you can extend yourself forever in any of the directions I have pointed to?" he went on. "Do you know that one moment can be eternity? This is not a riddle; it's a fact, but only if you mount that moment and use it to take the totality of yourself forever in any direction,". This is perhaps part of the reason Steiner equates the sun with Christ. Christ comes to us as an embodiment of the sun, to bring love to the earth, and so transform it giving it freedom and ego.

The solar wind is the voice of Eros calling us towards the future, the transcendent object, pulling us to ever greater hallucination.

The Greeks felt the sun pervading them inwardly; "[They] felt the sun as that which infused Love into the living organism, guiding Eros through the waves of sentient existence." This is the love Steiner also equates with the sun's gravity, a force of love that becomes so great that it creates "negative, sucking matter" inside the sun. This is not a new concept by any means: "[It is] love that moves the Sun and the other stars." This also equates Christ with Apollo "The connection with the sublime Sun spirit, which we have emphasized on a number of occasions, is also apparent in the Greek Apollo idea, for Apollo was the Sun god." However I'm not sure how McKenna would feel about Apollo being our transcendental object, so I'm thinking Dionysus also be a go between us and the sun, creating a mercurial membrane of hallucination. In Sloterdijk's *Spheres* he develops a similar love that holds a sphere together, which could quite easily be expanded to include the solar system: "I will develop, more obstinately than usual, the hypothesis that love stories are stories of form, and that every act of solidarity is an act of sphere formation, that is to say the creation of an interior". By placing love as the creator of the sphere, it also becomes an essential aspect in being human, and being able to live in the world. As Sloterdijk's spheres of love change scales as the consciousness of the time suits, They could be applied as Steiner points to a shift in the sun's energy at the time of Christ: "Christ stands before us, the Spirit Being who, through the Mystery of Golgotha, united Himself with the Earth. And He says to us: 'Be not dismayed that the Sun has become black; it is black because I, the God of the Sun, am no longer in it; for I have come down and united myself with the Earth.'" McKenna also identifies this as the time when the logos stopped speaking to us, how then has the logos been transformed? The Logos was probably lost as we moved into the rational age, the logos of the light of Christ that shone down upon us has been transformed, now the logos lives in us as imagination, intuition and inspiration as we cultivate the higher spiritual forces we are to develop. Whilst the light of the sun still shines with the raw light of Apollo, the energy of the absolute, that creates the Dionysian flowers in our mind:

> "In July 1884, at the age of forty, Nietzsche confided to his friend Resa von Schirnhofer that every time he closed his eyes "he saw a profusion of fantastic flowers, twining round each other and constantly growing, changing in shape and colour with exotic opulence, one sprouting wildly out of another". Nietzsche complained that these flowers "never give [him] any peace", and then asked Schirnhofer, "with a disturbing urgency", whether she thought his flowers could be "a symptom of incipient madness".

### Black hole

> "We are being sucked into the body of eternity" — Terrence McKenna

As we have seen the sun has some similarities to a black hole: "The Sun [is] a hollow space of suction which annihilates everything within it…. Anything brought to it is immediately absorbed and disappears." For our purposes these anatomies of the Tidal wave are all simultaneous truths and interchangeable: A black hole could be better described as a black whole, as the centre isn't really nothing, it is in fact an infinitely dense reality; a singularity containing all information that has entered it, folded up. You can't divide a singularity in two; it is a whole.

Six months after the death of their mother, McKenna and his brother journeyed into the amazon on a search for the then barely known ayahuasca, upon reaching their destination La Chorera, a rather pleasant valley with no biting insects etc, they did not find ayahuasca, but instead a great deal of psilocybin mushrooms. They proceeded to take extremely high doses over multiple days and recorded their findings. For years to come McKenna would continue to work through the insights that he gained from this experience. They believed at the time that they had discovered the philosopher's stone. And also laid the groundwork for Time wave theory. McKenna's Timewave theory uses the I-Ching to produce an algorithm, and then this algorithm is then placed alongside the timeline of history to "map" variances in complexity. McKenna argues that the history of the universe has been one of ever increasing complexity, it in fact is accelerating, and so, much like the theory of the singularity a la Ray Kurzweil. McKenna also placed the end of history, and the apocalypse or in his words the transcendental object at the end of time, in the year 2012. The transcendental object has been pulling us towards it ever since the universe began. And has perhaps been sending us messages and helping us reach towards it by using plant allies to help download information to us.

This theory is interesting to me particularly because we are now in the year 2017. It is a particularly interesting thought experiment if we take this passing through the apocalypse not as a disproof of Mckenna's theory but rather think how his thoughts may still hold a truth for us. He himself suggested that as we reach the transcendental object novelty/complexity will explode into the infinite, however much like a cosmonaut travelling in their spaceship into a black hole, time will subjectively expand outwards for us, due to relativity. So in effect shouldn't the apocalypse last for infinity? Let's continue McKenna's Black hole metaphor and see where it will lead us

If the year 2012 represents an event horizon, then after we pass through it we will see everything that has already passed into it, all of the past back to the beginning of time will be presented to us as a simultaneous present. And as we look in the other direction we see everything that will eventually enter into the black hole. If in a traditional black hole, it exists as a camera for that part of the universe and time collapses into it so that it records the history of the universe from its perspective.

History is increasingly known and distributed towards the present. So if we move into this Timewave black hole we see all of knowledge of the past that will enter this post historical period.

As we pass into a black hole we go through a series of horizon's, McKenna called them Ghost Horizons: I think of this event-horizon as a series of ghost-horizons, [that you pass through as you continue through history]. History is the outer shell of the gravitational field of the attractor of the concrescence." I.e. the singularity.

"There is a curious interface zone that is not the singularity and not the absence of the singularity. It's the singularity in the act of becoming, and it only lasts, as I say, a geological microsecond, 50,000 years."

Let's continue on our journey: "As you pass through the outer horizon, the horizon splits in two, there is no sign that you have crossed the horizon." We have reached a ghost horizon as we traverse history. This can be understood as an event in the physical or mental realm that retroactively changes the past, or brings it into view so that we may see it fully: "There is no way of telling what may yet become part of history. Perhaps the past is still essentially undiscovered! [...] Every great human being exerts a retroactive force: for his sake all of history is placed in balance again, and a thousand secrets of the past crawl out of their hiding places - into his sunshine."

"As you fall deeper inside the horizon, the horizon bubble enlarges." This is the perspective of time from the past warping into view. This is an image of very early magic consciousness developing. Simultaneously it is an image of a growing awareness of the past and a flattening of time that comes with integral-alchemical-final-participatory consciousness.

"As you approach the inner horizon, the black hole ahead stops expanding, and starts to shrink. It looks like you are moving away from the black hole, but that is not true. You are still free-falling inwards, towards the black hole. The shrinking is caused by relativistic beaming, which concentrates the view ahead." So our view of the future also shrinks as we move towards it, this is from the weight of the transcendental object, making it hard to see the future. "The same relativistic beaming causes light from the outside universe to become brighter and more blue-shifted around the black hole." So as the future seems to recede away, the past becomes closer to us, continuing to flatten towards simultaneity

"As you fall deeper into the black hole, the inward flow of space is slowed by the gravitational repulsion produced by the negative pressure of the radial electric field." Negative pressure elongates time as we move towards the apocalypse of the second horizon. Time slows down at this point, as the past approaches simultaneity with us and the future seems far away. Then as we pass through the second horizon and we see an image of history-past projected to the now in a blinding light. This blinding light in a black hole contains everything the black hole has ever 'seen', however to comprehend it we would need to be infinitely quick. After we pass the second horizon or anti-horizon we enter a period of time that is the worm hole after which we pass out into a white hole we pass back through an anti horizon and we see a blinding image of future history, of the universe we have just come from projected to the now, We may not be capable at the time of deciphering the data presented to us. As we go through the fourth horizon we see an image of the past history of the new universe, in a blinding light. The fourth horizon presents us with an image of the past that we never knew. Perhaps of a new realm such as the astral or the spiritual or a quantum string dimension

The Big bang has a consistent acceleration of expansion as the birth of a black hole, very quickly at first and then increasingly slower, as stated above "the inward flow of space is slowed by the gravitational repulsion produced by the negative pressure of the radial electric field." and this negative pressure gets bigger as the black hole grows. So some theoretical physicists believe our universe originated in the singularity of the big bang/bounce, and all enclosed in an event horizon. If this is the case there could be an infinite number of universes enclosing one another. "every time a supermassive star collapses in a type II supernova and creates a central black hole, a new, two-dimensional Universe is created"

We may very well pass through a series of black holes as we make our way through history, evolving up the spiritual hierarchies whilst falling through time towards the Transcendental object.

### Sonic Boom

If we look at our place in time and the evolution of consciousness, we find ourselves moving into post-history and post-rational consciousness. We find ourselves moving towards a final participation (Barfield), and into magic (Alan Moore), in an increasing hallucination of connective technology (McKenna). As we pass into the realm of post-history we find that the interconnections of Magic/alchemy/Shamanism are infinitely more complex, as it now contains the accumulative sonic boom of history. To be a practicing magician now, will be to open ourselves to ever greater depths: "We might have lost the Light and the Height; but more frightening, we have lost the Mystery and the deep, the Emptiness and the Abyss."

> "keep growing, keep changing, we shed our old bark, we shed our skins every spring, we keep becoming younger, fuller of future, taller, stronger, we push our roots ever more powerfully into the depths - into evil - while at the same time we embrace the heavens ever more lovingly, more broadly, imbibing their light ever more thirstily with all our twigs and leaves.
> 
> Like trees we grow - this is hard to understand, as is all of life - not in one place but everywhere, not in one direction but equally upward and outward and inward and downward; our energy is at work simultaneously in the trunk, branches and roots; we are no longer free to do one particular thing, to be only one particular thing."

### A.I

Artificial intelligence will transform consciousness, much like the invention of fire, the wheel and the printing press. This section also can talk about technology as an essential part of what makes us human, and Ai as possibly making us more human. However, there could also be a loss of agency. Much like the monkey who is an automation tool for the magician but can become pathological so can A.I. As the magician becomes increasingly dependent on external systems for decision-making. When the magician cedes control to AI, it risks losing touch with its own inner wisdom, becoming a passive observer rather than an active participant in the unfolding of reality.

The magician must always strive to maintain sovereignty over their own consciousness.

## Real world outcomes

> "We should live as if the apocalypse has already occurred and will happen again." — Terrence McKenna

How should we expand our castle, and the society of all castles, to its full potential? so that we may question Infinite Being, become living, really incarnate fully, and become a creator, a magician? We will need both chaos and order in order that we may facilitate the next apocalypse, the next evolution of consciousness.

|  | Chaotic | Un-chaotic |
|---|---|---|
| **Ordered** | Creative | Tyranny |
| **Dis-ordered** | Anarchy | Zombie |

The goal of life is to expand consciousness for all beings, this is what we call freedom. Dis-integrated consciousness finds systems to help itself find freedom. We could call this system ordered chaos. Some dis-integrated consciousness become pathological, in their quest for freedom they may use too little order or too little chaos. There are 4 basic outcomes on a chaos order axis. Tyrannical order is too extreme and fixed, it cannot integrate new chaos. anarchists have too little order to hold the amount of chaos they would like. Zombies have neither enough chaos or order. order accumulates power and chaos expands the possibilities of how we can use it. A consciousness will see itself as the centre of the scale between anarchy and tyranny, that is the nature of pathology, otherwise they would be able to correct themselves. A creative has the ability to create and to share this with others. A consciousness has the ability to impinge on the freedom of another consciousness in proportion to its power. So the struggles we see playing out over and over in mythology, politics and science fiction are between tyranny and creative individuals.

*(Facilitating the apocalypse/utopia)*

I also would like to do my part to increase the speed at which we head towards the singularity of complexity. As I would say it is the evolution of consciousness and the flowering of love. To love is to know. So the intent is talismanic integral art, of unified complexity.

Covid has certainly increased the multiple possible realities that exist in simultaneous contrast. Most people have to choose a side and stay there. However there may be multiple truths existent.

So there is a yearning for the apocalypse/utopia. These are the same thing. We are moving towards strangeness. Which is at once nauseating and orgasmic. Of course I would like to embody love but everything always contains its opposite. Consider the sexual act which is so bodily, our bodies confront us with their blood and guts. Some people are fearful of sex for this reason and have developed defence mechanisms and psychoses; they do not accept the physical side of sex.

## ART

### Enkiverse (a manifesto)

**ENKIVERSE** takes its name from Enki, a forerunner of Prometheus, who gave humanity the keys to elevate ourselves to the position of gods.

**Enki-Verse = A song of the universe which unlocks, unfurls and blossoms mind.**

The Enkiverse is an ever expanding psycho-spatial artworld mythology encompassing the artistic practice of Zed

> The fine art of painting, which is the bastard of alchemy, always has been and always will be, a game. The rules of the game are quite simple: in a given arena, on as many psychic fronts as the talent allows, one must visually describe, the center of the meaning of existence. — Brett Whiteley

If we had to choose a term to describe Enkiverse it would be Visionary. This term has the attitude of expanding reality beyond the material realm. It is in effect bringing mind into matter. It contains fields such as sci-fi and eroticism within it. Also the psychic landscape which contains romanticism. All of this is embodied. These are forms which are graspable to human comprehension. Meaning provoking. Unlocking meaning.

In terms of medium Enkiverse uses many forms: painting, video, performance, words etc

Video is arguably a more evocative art form; the aesthetic seduction quickly unlocks our emotions. However so far ENKIVERSE has had the most success with painting to generate circus troupes of avatars. The art form of painting allows for a creation process that can contain plenty of feedback loops. It is built on a series of movements like going for a long walk, digging a hole, or building a pyramid out of bricks. This can allow for plenty of revision at every point, and for mind to reveal itself. It's messy, muddy, physical and alchemical. So plenty to be betting on within terms of embodiment of active imagination

### Visionary art

Visionary art usually defines a relatively narrow period beginning with Ernst Fuchs and flourishing into the psychedelic revolution. It often overlaps with psychedelic art. Most art in any area is drab, and stereotypical, and psychedelic and visionary art are no different. However if we are to use these terms correctly, visionary and psychedelic by definition would be highly original. They look beyond what is known and expand the psyche. As such stylistic recognisability is hard to define and is antithetical to visionary art. When we use the term in this way we can look back through time and find that all the really great art is visionary.

### Sci-fi

The Science fiction genre allows for the greatest expansion of consciousness. The greatest possibility to create links. It allows complete freedom to draw on any source, embracing fantasy, the "real" world, the distant future, mythology, aliens, magic, time travel, spirituality etc.

I think what we are really talking about here though is that my paintings are figurative and that they may even have a narrative, which has been mostly absent from recent popular painting. Why not integrate the rich realm of narrative? I suppose I have gravitated towards a sci-fi picture style as it is in line with my maximal tastes. I mean, if one is trying to integrate as many symbols as possible including understandings of space that have taken place within painting history such as perspectival devices, atmosphere and the feeling of the picture being a window onto a world or a stage, then I'm not sure what other style would be left? The sci-fi diorama seems the natural outcome to me! haha...

I think some people cringe when they hear the word sci-fi, I think this may be perhaps because we are worried that we are about to experience something that may only tick the boxes of the trope, rather than pushing the envelope and introducing some original thought. I think each classification comes with its own opportunities and pitfalls, there are plenty of emotional and conceptual resonances and meandering that sci-fi landscapes may conjure up. Some of my paintings go further than others into this genre's tropes, they become almost immediately recognisable, like a 70's sci-fi novel cover. I hope these paintings will approach the viewer playfully, luring in with their public accessibility, and introducing them to this world, which can then branch outwards, linking in further concepts.

*(can include in this section something about The Foundation Stones book)*

Eroticism / Orgasmysticism
There is a thread of eroticism that runs through visionary artists from Blake, to Dali, to Ernst Fuchs. Drawing on Freud and Jung there is a sexual force that motivates everything. And this sexual force exists in the collective unconscious. That is the anima, which is also the source of creative ability for man, or the animus for a woman. Confronting the shadow is only a minor work in comparison to confronting your anima/animus; your sexual counterpart.
Erotic energy is the first mover of the kabbalah. "Identifying Keter, the uppermost sefirah with delight and desire…. Keter can be regarded as a primary source of psychic energy or volition, the Kabbalists understood it as initiating a series of sexual relations among the sefirot" "Keter is referred to as the will of all wills". So in this view erotic energy is the most basic force. The erotic goes hand in hand with the visionary as artists tap into the ground of being. Eros is the first god in Parmenides' ancient Greek cosmology that impels evolution. Eroticism is the fabric at the centre of being. We can see a flowing sea of being that has an erotic nature in that it is always reaching towards something. Look at the phallic Yonic forms that are created when one substance flows into another. Look at a field of grass stretching up towards the sun. it is at the heart of life that surrounds us that emerges out of chaos. The Mandelbrot set is erotic. Or a particle collider trace map.
[Images of Mandelbrot set and particle collider traces would go here]
This erotic force is everywhere in some ways it is also the life force. Tarkovsky's Mirror and Bruegel's The Suicide of Saul, both flow with the same energy. This energy is an erotic force that flows through O'Keeffe and Bernini.
[Images would go here]
And in many artists this erotic life force energy forms rivers of bodies. In Rubens, Joffra, Bouguereau, and many others the bodies float and are unrestrained by gravity. The bodies become like particles or a flock of birds. There has to be enough of a buildup that a crescendo of chaos is reached. Much like how a single human house may not be particularly organic looking but when we see enough houses spread over a town looking down from a mountain or from a satellite, we begin to see its fractal and organic nature.
As humans we are highly attuned to the human body, closely followed by the face and then the eyes. Every small gesture generates an emotional response in us. In addition to this the body is a sexual force, seeing it en masse gives it a grouping akin to an orgy, or to a colony of ants. There is an element of abandoning reason for Dionysian oblivion and of joining with the chaotic forces that surround our body.
When we have sex do we engulf or are we engulfed?
[Images would go here]
Eroticism is the greatest force of materialisation, of embodiment.
It contains the guts and the skin. It is the garment of blood that must be worn to embrace experience in its profuse expanse. (see Jesus and The Clouds of Ololon in Immortality)

So saying, the Virgin divided Six-fold & with a shriek
Dolorous that ran thro all Creation a Double Six-fold Wonder!
Away from Ololon she divided & fled into the depths
Of Milton's Shadow as a Dove upon the stormy Sea.
Then as a Moony Ark Ololon descended to Felphams Vale
In clouds of blood, in streams of gore, with dreadful thunderings
Into the Fires of Intellect that rejoiced in Felphams Vale

look out for the Moony ark and streams of erotic gore in the images below.
[Images of artworks by Ewoud van Rijn, Richard Dadd, Johfra would go here]
These figures can easily become abstracted, As in Johfra and Van Rijn. The figures become a single substance like clay. We see the same thing in Dali, Escher and others when they atomise figures and clothing. We are clearly talking about a realm of forms. So although seemingly violent dismemberment is taking place there is a sense that the body exists beyond the physical. It is a forming force that is being visualised. The morphogenetic field of Sheldrake, or the astral plane of Blavatsky and Steiner.
[Images of artworks by Dali, philippe caza, Escher, Moebius, mati klarwein, Tchelitchew, Harry Zed Hughes would go here]

"the whole creation will be consumed and appear infinite and holy…
This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment."
If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.
For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern.

I see a hallucinogenic eroticism contained within all life, and I hope that my art will reflect and highlight this. Overt figurative sexuality is an extension of this. I think we need a healthy injection of bacchanalian dream states into our materialist bean counting society. Depictions of sexuality in a fine art context are highly controversial. And it is no exception for me, Firstly because male depictions of women are seen as objectifying. And secondly because there is a division between the new age spiritual movement and the social justice movement, which often sacrifices character traits for equality. As a man I do not wish to perpetuate anything which may demean women, but I also wish to value and depict the powerful sexual force that I see within people and especially women.

A note on objectification
It would be prudent at this point to respond to the complaint of the objectification of women. Let's unpack this statement as it is a term often used but do we really understand what it means?
Art objectifies and subjectifies everything. Artifice is the materialisation or embodiment of something, it is necessarily objectifying by definition. At the same time art is created from subjective experience. The problem objectifying women in art happens on another level. The argument is leveled that women are depicted with less agency than men. They are pigeon holed as passive. Without going too far into this there are elements of the feminine and masculine psyche that do contain their own traits and these cannot be wholly dismissed. For instance it is commonly expressed from sex therapists that men and women both benefit from focusing energy on the woman. There is a primal preference for the masculine to be focusing on the feminine, which is desirable for both sexes. Of course these are generalities but they are still useful.
First off I would like to state that, all art is valuable whether made from a male or a female, art history has often overlooked women and this should be revised. Everything should be judged on aesthetic merit.
Ideology creates a shadow that it designates as degenerate. The Nazi's pushed out abstraction and expressionism. And the CIA backed west pushed out realism.
Consumerism and the cult of the individual structured by Edward Bernays, push away satisfaction and gratitude. And focus us on receiving material rather than creating.
We still feel the reverberations and jargon, from these ideologies. Figuration is seen as non-progressive, Abstraction as degenerate, and symbolism and expressionism as relic's.
It is of utmost importance that male artists are able to depict women. They explore how their own sexual urges may be unified into the broader architecture of art. Furthermore we must find healthy evolutions of the erotic/artistic depiction of women. It is important that we do not reduce them to lacking agency. But we also need to develop a language of their unique and shared powers. If this is to be done in a unified way that is beautiful and erotic we are going to need the full arsenal of contemporary art. Otherwise we pair back this task to advertising, popular cinema and pornography, in other words to materialist consumerism. Rather than the scope of academic thought and the fine arts, which are broader in ontological scope.
When someone paints a woman, especially if it's a male artist, then we call it male fantasy, just a degenerate vision of utopia. Our modern dominant ideology has become tied up with tearing down many of the hierarchies and structures of the past. Gender is one of these structures, which there is a long intellectual and spiritual tradition of exploration into, that now has become taboo.
All art falls into a particular ideology. East German and West German art. The abstract expressionists deny all figuration. Certain art forms are narrowed out as not conforming to current ideologies. The current ideology has problems with men depicting women, with nude bodies and figuration in general, and even with the idea of beauty or of anything that could be construed as sentimental. There have been similar wholesale exclusions of "degenerate" art during the time of Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia or Western Modernism.
Men have always looked at women. Do we think we will stop women being objectified by stopping all male artists from painting women? What on earth do we think we will accomplish? It's just a matter of taste, which has clearly emerged. We are afraid of truth. Afraid of structure and hierarchy and of delineation of differentiation. These elements are instead pushed into the shadows. They become unconscious and in fact dangerous. If men aren't going to depict women, how are we going to evolve that capacity within ourselves? How can we develop an erotic love that encompasses mind and body, and lets the creative juices flow? Instead we push the erotic away and say you are not worthy of art and so the erotic is pushed away to the porn industry. And to advertising and to tv/movies. How are we meant to develop our imaginations hampered in this way? Furthermore we are scared of the beautiful. Classifying it again as degenerate, or amateur. I want to re-embrace the amateur. I think once we re-awaken these forces of body erotic and beauty romanticism there will actually be plenty of progress to be made.
This is important.
For example William Blake sees the many facets of the feminine as aspects of the city of our imagination. The feminine imagination meets with the masculine consciousness. in a sexual alchemy that allows us to know ourselves, allows us to reveal infinite being.

"Jerusalem, "a city, yet a woman", is builded in the heart of every man by acts of love and kindness, and this is the work of the imagination."

why female emanations are essential:

"When in Eternity Man converses with Man they enter
Into each others Bosom (which are Universes of delight)
In mutual interchange. and first their Emanations meet
Surrounded by their Children. if they embrace & comingle
The Human Four-fold Forms mingle also in thunders of Intellect
But if the Emanations mingle not; with storms & agitations
Of earthquakes & consuming fires they roll apart in fear
For Man cannot unite with Man but by their Emanations
Which stand both Male & Female at the Gates of each Humanity"

Blake can be seen to have a strong relationship with his anima, his Jerusalem. And the emanations of the fourfold human which are female forms
Some of my paintings will be of a specific woman and will hopefully contain many individual traits, others will be depicting spirits of a particular force, much like Greek gods and goddess' are often singular points of character, an individual human may exhibit varying tendencies of many gods as aspects of their personality. Art in my eyes has a tendency and perhaps an obligation towards generalities. For an artwork to hold up to multiple viewers it needs to contain universalities. I hope that no one views any painting as a statement that the depiction is always true for every individual. I certainly wouldn't want someone to view one of my paintings of a woman and to think that this is how I see all women, or how I would like all women to be. It is rather a depiction of an experiential force; this is my experience of erotic energy, It is my hope that when others view this they will feel the connection between eroticism, power and energy, Eros as a fundamental force in the creation of life, and feminine energy, Yin and mother earth as the birthing power base that is the bedrock of all energetic growth.
I am a mere man. Shall I be forbidden to worship at the altar of women? Must we only depict ourselves? Every artwork ends up being a self portrait in the end, but must we also begin as a self portrait? Or can we at least begin by trying to depict our experience of the other?

The Erotic Landscape
The eroticism we are defining is not only in the figure. We see the same forces embodied in the landscape. Let us take the landscape paintings of Courbet for example, who tapped into the erotic bodily force and the river of life.

All those numerous paintings by Courbet come to mind, which show a slit or a ledge, a dark, usually moist grotto. … Of course, Courbet's earth is female, the big mother, "la terre" as the giving maw (Metken, 1997, p.55)

[Image: Courbet, "The Source of the Loue", oil on Canvas]

"He discovered virgin lands where no one had yet placed a foot, aspects and forms of landscape that one could say were unknown before he painted them.... Each time he plunged into the bosom of deep nature, he was like a man who has penetrated a beehive and come out covered with honey; he returned charged with perfume and poetry. He descended into the deep irregular hollows where the spring is born of the trickle from rocks, he watched the drops of water collect, let slide between his fingers the silver of small waterfalls. ... No one painted in strokes so frank, just that quivering humidity. One cannot contemplate Stream of the Puits Noir, Source of the Loue, Shaded Stream, all these fresh and bright landscapes ... without receiving them like a gust of pure air right in the face"

I would however contend with "virgin" lands, and flip it, so that a person that hasn't been into nature is the virgin. As nature is in perpetual copulation all by itself. We are the virgins when we remain couped up in our modern world plugged in to technology without feeling the wind on our face and the smell of ripe and rotting plants.

Romanticism
Romanticism is all about reclaiming the body of emotion. Arising first out of the industrial revolution as we were undergoing a materialist spiritual split. Romanticism is needed once again to seduce the viewer into an experience of chaos that is outside their consumer ideology.
Nigel Cooke and Peter Doig are good examples of this type of radical painting - one which contains a romantic spirit, and uses aesthetic effects to make non-linear arguments. After discussing examples from these artists, we will return to the death of painting and how photography, conceptualism and cinema feeds into the resurrection of painting as romantic.
"Medium" once designated the physical material that you worked with, and within the parameters of, to create. For quite some time now it has moved beyond the physical medium to the embodied medium; or to the apparatus of that medium. Painting in this expanded field, using non-traditional materials, is an embodiment of painting without using the physical medium. A comprehensive definition of "medium" will take on both the physical and embodied. It is in using physical paint that the full force of medium comes into play, and perhaps it is for this reason that painting, more so than sculpture or photography, has held onto the physical nature of its medium. Perhaps this is mostly due to its long history.
Nigel Cooke is an artist that provides a good example of a kind of painting that is New Romanticism. He provides an example of engagement with a history of the medium, in a contemporary context, along with his use of multiple levels of syntax within a pictorial whole. To paint now, in a period full of postmodern ironies, one must be fully aware of all the rejections of modernism that have taken place. When Nigel Cooke paints it is from a Metamodern standpoint, that is he tries to create something beautiful, that at the same time contains a healthy scepticism and irony. He at once acknowledges the death of painting and creates something new in the dark space that follows, in the disintegration of the pictorial space.
Nigel Cooke's self criticality is embodied by his characters that take on the artist's seemingly pointless search for meaning, they are depicted in desolate post-apocalyptic landscapes with often storm-like masses of abstract brush strokes filling the sky. Nigel Cooke describes these characters as "a generic creative figure, I wanted to embody creative thought in a certain form. Part Van Gogh and part philosopher tramp vagrant from ancient historical painting, a St Sebastian or St Jerome figure." I think if we look at St. Jerome In The Wilderness by Andrea Mantegna we can easily see St Jerome fitting into a scene of Cooke's such as To work is to play. In Mantegna's Jerome Painting, we can see a similar composition to some of Cooke's Paintings: the large rock behind Jerome takes up most of the painting and dwarves the figure, and to the sides of the rock we find keyhole like vistas onto far away landscapes. Mimosa in Valbonne is a good example of a similarly composed painting. Both Mantegna and Cooke are trying to unite multiple genres, for Mantegna the landscape and the figure painting, for Cooke abstract painting and cartoon and figures in a landscape.
If we take the traditional Jerome in the wilderness as painted throughout history, the depictions of wilderness seem to become more foreign than other paintings which may be set indoors, perhaps this is due to the highly constructed nature of an outdoor scene, which must logistically be painted inside. If we take Titian's St. Jerome In The Wilderness this construction is highly evident, and yet it does not take away from the painting but adds to it. We feel the man, the rock, the tree and the background as separate elements resting in the dim stage set of the painting surface, here we truly feel the desolation, and the abstinence of the monk that has removed himself from the world of man. In Cooke's To work is to play, we find an equally desolate constructed landscape, architectural forms reminiscent of Russian constructivist architecture and concrete jungle type contemporary public architecture. Squares and rectangles seem to drift out of this architecture and to rest ambiguously between the scene and the canvas/picture plane, perhaps these have drifted out of a Mondrian or another abstract hard edge painting. Cooke's Painting contrasts Mondrian in his irony, Cooke's constructed world full of art and artist like figures is always falling apart, it is doomed to fail from the start, Cooke knows this and yet he continues to paint anyway. Mondrian on the other hand continued his modernist paintings for many years seemingly without much change once he found his signature style. Where was Mondrian's self criticality? He believed he found the truth without question, and was brazen enough to give up on many tropes of figurative representation, thus abandoning common man, in his eyes rising up to a new plane. But where is the beauty here? And most importantly where is the human? Mondrian's Heroism is reflected in the failed socialist architecture depicted in To work is to play, the utilitarian utopian vision has descended into a ghetto for the hopeless, perhaps this is the fate that awaits the hubris of the heroic artist.

Cooke's New Accursed Art Club, is another example of themes we have talked about around the artist figure lost in their own landscape. However the title suggests that these figures are being art critics, some perhaps painters, but others reading contemplating or just drinking, they are perhaps merrymakers and patrons enjoying themselves and their prestige while from an exterior view they have fallen from grace. I am immediately reminded of Peter Doig's Metropolitain (House of Pictures), which is at once a replication of Daumier's Collector, and a carnival character: the European flaneur, a self portrait of Doig as an onlooker that fetishises the Trinidad world around him in a series of vistas. The purveyor of fine scenes, the voyeur. In Doig's painting the Collector has a red nose from the Trinidad sun and white cheeks. He is in fact a clown. We see here a repeat of the self criticality of the artist/critique found in Cooke's images. They both draw on this tradition from Daumier and his many paintings of collectors and artists, Daumier at once critiques the strange clicky atmosphere of the art world, whilst living in it. Cooke's paintings go further than Daumier though as Cooke is trying to turn "painting into a place or a being. Making a place tangible and realised" he hopes to embody tasks and emotions in his paintings in order to make them stand on their own in a world post-paintings death.

Another Painting By Doig Grande Riviere is the first painting Doig made of Trinidad, he began it from a series of photographs he had taken there of an old white horse surrounded by corbou (small black vultures). This scene depicted in this painting could easily have become a pretty cliché landscape painting, but Doig's treatment produces a sinister undertone: to begin with there are no people, which introduces an eerie silence, that is compounded by the darkness of the sky shadows and water, and the humid saturation of colour in the dense foliage that fills the horizon. The starry sky drifts down into the water, however it is reflected so clearly that it becomes an actual sky itself, upon which the landscape hovers, the brightness of the sand and the horse at night adds to this mystical feeling. They appear to glow as if producing their own light, it's not hard to imagine the horse as Doig himself surrounded his demons. We are reminded here of Heart Of Darkness, a colonial guilt and fear, Doig asks himself why did I come here? It isn't my place. To find out he continues to paint there in his studio, Perhaps as a Marlow looking for his Kurtz.
[Image: Grande Riviere 2001-02, 228.8 x 358.4 cm Peter Doig]
This next painting by Peter Doig carries on in the mystical theme, Doig's paintings are romantic in that they convey a sense of yearning that the viewer can lose themselves in. It is important to note that his mystic romanticism is always balanced by melancholy and a sinister darkness. Once again the stars appear to permeate the surface and cut through solid objects, clouds, water and the road. This places the cloudscape in the realm of a Hubble photographed nebula. And there is a sense that the figures are misplaced in their costumes, imposters, perhaps alien. That look straight at the viewer, as gatekeepers to an alien world over the rainbow bridge
[Image: Gasthof zur Muldentalsperre, 2000/02, 196 x 296 cm, Peter Doig]
The potential of the painting medium lies in its set of coordinates, its terrain in art history. It takes attributes and areas of reference from its long history as well as modern and postmodern challenges that have changed it forever. At multiple points the challenges to painting have been so fundamental, that painting was claimed to be dead. However with the clarity of vision that comes from observing the actual effect on painting, we can see that these catalyst moments have only deepened it. in the words of Nietzsche "what does not kill me makes me stronger".
Photography killed painting; it killed the photographic part, painting as a documentary tool. This allowed painting to be reborn, as an expression of things other than documentation: leading to expressionism, symbolism, futurism and other Avant-garde movements. Similarly Duchamp with the readymade, and conceptual art that followed, killing painting again by privileging the idea over the image. Painting from a conceptual art standpoint, was seen as too traditional and beautiful. Beauty and feeling were disregarded and often rejected, and the idea was held as the groundwork from which physical material was constructed. Anti-aesthetic here rests as the default position. Conceptual art stands within postmodernism, it is one of many reactions to the naive heroism of modernism, along with installation and performance art.
After modernism and its rebounding critical postmodernism, painting has been repeatedly dismissed in art criticism. Painting is no longer a default position to hold for any educated contemporary artist. To paint now is a conceptual choice, it is anti-heroic, and it is a resurrection of spontaneity. As a conceptual choice it contains an enormous syntax of philosophical spiritual and social ideas. Along with its materiality that allows room for anti-narrative. Painting can be more radical than most conceptual art, as its nature is indeterminate, a picture cannot be expressed in words, and is thus a confounding non-lingual eminence, that sears into the eyes of our science-obsessed age. Unlike in photography and cinema the brush mark itself becomes a construction, we are confronted with an ever dissolving set of forms that move between gesture, cartoon, dream, light based representation, line based arabesque, colourful daubs, stains, and particle clouds. Here there is no ground and there is nothing to grasp, we just fall forever past possibilities of worlds we won't know. This is a body without organs, and a thousand plateaus.

"Painting can no longer just be painting. Today it is also necessarily a form of conceptual art, and as such it must be judged in relation to conceptual practices in other media, and in turn it must hold its own in this comparison." — VERWOERT

Though Paintings recent dark ages following its deaths, the hopeful romantic spirit has fled to other mediums such as photography and most notably cinema. Cinema is the most effective medium, it has the most access to the emotions through an enveloping experience, it is also time based and therefore can contain music in sync with images. As a medium closely related to photography it managed to avoid the death of figuration that painting went through. It remained as a storytelling medium that was never to forgo beauty. Through film makers such as Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, Hitchcock, Kubrick and even David Lynch whose anti-narrative and multi planar films, that sit happily within a postmodern framework, still remain beautiful and moving on an emotional level. Cinema in this sense managed to retain a certain amount of romanticism. And as Painting once again regains its romantic spirit, in a nonetheless more self-conscious form, it draws from cinema as its most immediate predecessor. This is necessary because cinema doesn't have the absolute freedom of painting, the propensity for self-reflexive, process based creation. The artist begins to understand as they make, more than other mediums. As everything that the artwork will be is already there to witness, unlike the movie editing process, which always sits between shooting and viewing. Painting is a medium to live with, while it is being made and when it is in our home/space. It is an adjunct to our lives that can slide between object in the room or subjective experience when the image has our complete attention.
Values traditionally argued to be against painting are actually best held by painting. Conceptual art via syntax. Performance via process. Critique of time and space, and knowing, via mark making and Worlding, it draws attention to the construction of a reality that we are never fully omniscient of, more so even than cinema. The medium has multiple systems of truth built into it. The tangled mess that is painting, its contrasting histories, techniques and styles, builds to a horizon of complex possibilities. Its strength is non-verbal, visual nature, which embraces complexity. A painting's beauty; the aesthetic experience, traditional or otherwise, can generate a criticality in itself: when a viewer perceives something as beautiful, they are already convinced conceptually by the content of the painting, not the physical content, but the emotional felt experience. The viewer understands through the experience, not a literal concept or lingual reasoning, but rather a rhizomatic displacement of their reality into the reality of the painting.

COMMUNITY
The magic rabbit community
This is an extension of the real world outcomes section, beyond painting, and into the intentional community I am creating. It's important that this is included, as Integration stretches outwards beyond the artwork, until everything is the artwork. Moving towards the ultimate life affirming YES. the magic rabbit. the Child. Passing through to the next wave. Falling through to the next step. Choose love over fear to make the next step rather than becoming rigid. Love is the state of the child. The state of creative freedom. No hesitation.

Freedom is a choice
We can be grateful that we are born in an age when the default stance is to do what you are told and to not step outside of the centralised treadmill that has been laid out for us. Freedom of thought and action is not a default right that is given to us. Instead it must be taken. We must consciously reach out and flip the switch. And decide we want to be free.
For better or worse we are moving towards a slave and master world. The super rich have gradually centralised all the power for the slave's own safety. So anyone not awake enough to step into the new world will simply stay in the old one. Perhaps the controlling mega powers of the world are doing us a dark favour.

Political
Living freedom vs. dead freedom (pathological)
Chaos and order. Pathological freedom. However order is a characteristic of the current narrative. Could we just say that there is a natural swing backwards and forwards?
Hard times > strong men (stressors strengthen mitochondria, stagnant cells die. fasting detox)
Strong men > good times (chaos is integrated into new order)
Good times > weak men (order becomes stagnant if it stops moving and integrating chaos. people become complacent last men. they are fearful and contracting, they are scared of something new.)
weak men > hard times (stagnancy becomes disease) (order and chaos are divided.)
The body is order-holding chaos. New chaotic elements are continuously integrated into the body. If a new chaos is rejected out of fear the body will become stagnant. Eventually the chaos will find a way to enter and the stagnant cells will die. a new paradigm will be established.
Freedom is order-integrating chaos. Without chaos there is no movement, so no freedom.
Without order there is no body, so no freedom.
If you believe a body is pathological you must make a new body. Destroying or trying to hold on to the old body will not work.

Environmental
The community is designed to integrate harmoniously with the surrounding rainforest environment. Principles of permaculture are followed to create a sustainable system that works with nature. Food forests provide fruit and nut trees integrated with vegetable gardens, without the need for clearing land or artificial fertilizers. Water catchment systems collect rainfall and channel it to where it is needed. Renewable energy like solar panels and micro hydro power generation is utilized. Buildings are constructed from natural and recycled materials and designed to have low environmental impact. Waste streams are minimized through composting systems. Overall, the community aims to enrich the rainforest ecosystem rather than deplete it.

Financial
The community embraces free market economics and the right to accumulate personal wealth and property. Members are encouraged to be entrepreneurial and generate abundance through business ventures. Those who succeed financially are respected for their ingenuity. However, the most financially successful members are expected to generously give back by funding community growth and supporting members in need. The goal is cooperative capitalism that lifts up the community as a whole. Strategic reinvestment of profits aims to maximize efficiency, innovation and self-sufficiency. Sound money based on intrinsic value is preferred over fiat currency. Savings are encouraged to provide security and capital for investment. Overall, a prosperity mindset prevails - wealth creation through free exchange is viewed as beneficial for all.

Legal
The community adheres to principles of natural law and non-aggression. Disputes are resolved internally whenever possible. Members voluntarily agree to binding arbitration and restitution systems managed within the community. Defensive force is sanctioned if needed to secure person and property from clear aggression. Victimless actions are not deemed criminal offenses. The community seeks self-governance and separation from centralized state authority to the extent feasible. Governing decisions are made at the most local level possible. Legal priorities are securing the community's autonomy and promoting members' wellbeing. External laws are only respected when they do not clearly violate individual sovereignty or community values.

Social
The community maintains a sense of exclusivity from the outside world. Social bonds within the group are emphatically promoted and valued above external ties. Longstanding members exemplify community virtues and provide guidance to new members during their integration phase. Acceptance of community beliefs is cultivated through immersive lifestyle conditioning. Individual expression is encouraged to strengthen the community's diverse skill sets. Members aim to improve humanity through pioneering enlightened modes of living. Contact with outsiders is generally limited to commerce and recruitment of new members. Periodic community rituals and traditions reinforce solidarity and commitment to shared ideals. An atmosphere prevails that being part of the community makes one elevated above the ignorance and dysfunction of mainstream society.

Bucky the critical path
The community utilizes architectural principles focused on efficiency, modularity, and natural beauty. Homes are constructed from earthships, cob, and other techniques using on-site and natural materials. Geodesic dome structures inspired by visionary Buckminster Fuller allow large communal spaces enclosed by graceful geometric forms. Passive solar orientation, rainwater harvesting, and renewable energy systems are incorporated to maximize sustainability. Buildings are harmoniously integrated into the surrounding forest through organic shapes and earth-toned colors. Yet modern conveniences like running water, electricity, and the internet are readily available. Structures are adaptable and expandable using modular components, giving the community flexibility to grow. Transportation infrastructure emphasizes walkability, cycling, and electric vehicles. Overall, architecture aims to merge ecological design with technological innovation and aesthetic elegance.

Cultural
The community prioritizes shared spaces that strengthen social bonds and cultivate culture. A central temple provides gathering space for rituals, ceremonies, and contemplation. The dining hall hosts nightly communal meals. The recreation center offers opportunities for physical activity, creativity, and leisure. The bathhouse provides rejuvenating hydrotherapy experiences. Libraries grant access to information resources and media. Performance spaces enable artistic expression through music, theater, and dance. Shops offer goods and services while bringing people together. Plazas, gardens, and natural areas provide additional communal space. These shared amenities are designed to enrich relationships, foster togetherness, and elevate the community's collective lived experience.

(ai generated) Spiritual life emphasizes direct mystical communion with the natural world. Time spent alone meditating in the forest is encouraged. Psychedelic sacraments provide glimpses of alternate realities and oneness with the universe. Yogic practices harmonize body, mind and spirit. Sacred geometry, astrology, and numerology reveal hidden cosmic wisdom. Pagan-inspired rituals. High holy days mark the passing seasons with ceremonies and celebration. Members embody earth-based spirituality; living interdependently with the complex web of life. Spiritual insights are validated through shared experiential gnosis rather than dogmatic belief. The spiritual path is one of ever-unfolding enlightenment and mystery.

Sexual
(Freedom without harm.)

Do as thou wilt -
Fulfilment of all desire
The community holds a libertine view toward sexuality, believing consenting adults should have freedom to responsibly explore their desires. Committed relationships are neither forbidden nor mandatory. Ethical non-monogamy and polyamory are accepted. Members are encouraged to communicate their needs and manage jealousy proactively. Sexual energy is valued as sacred life-force that can be harnessed for individual and collective empowerment.

JOURNEY
Increasing the bandwidth of life
(this section doesn't mention the castle ontology or the magician but it has some examples of active imagination. This swing can be used in many realms. It builds our imaginal castle. The swing is also how our magician builds the life force of our castle. and its powers of reasoning and concentration. so the swing optimises and increases bandwidth at all levels of being so that there can be a powerful flow from the physical all the way to the higher self (magician) through all layers of being.)
We exist in a space between two extremes. The height and the depth. We can imagine ourselves travelling horizontally through time, we are existing in a band that can vary in width. Many people live a bland life, their band is narrow. There is a gravitational pull that always brings some of the band towards the middle line, so if you have a narrow band it will never reach far into the heights or depths. Whereas if you have a wide band you can reach up further into the heights or depths whilst fulfilling the needs of the gravity of the middle line.
One bandwidth axis we exist in is between Apollo and Dionysus, Apollo is seen as the god of reason, and Dionysus as the god of the irrational. We can also see this as the conscious and the subconscious.
In the case of the imagination it can be a delicate balance between these two natures. If we try to direct our vision we may become trapped in our conscious quest and remain only apollonian. To escape your Apollo nature you must invert your desired outcome momentarily and then ride the rebound once you have dipped yourself in the soup of the crucible. And conversely to go deeper into the Dionysian subconscious soup it helps to record your image stream in some way. Otherwise the thought stream may pass you by and be forgotten as new thoughts replace them. Once recorded, or pulled further up into the consciousness of the perceivable world, the creations are then added to the collections of avatars heading back down into the crucible. The more that is created the more Avatars are created that may re-enter the soup. Two images come to mind here. One is that of the river of time that needs to be dammed in order that we may retain some of the flow in the present. The other is of a big ball that is rolling in a bowl of hot wax. If we are able to cool the ball enough from above it will retain a layer of wax every time it rolls around. This way we can make the ball larger. We are building feedback loops between realms of consciousness that build creation.

Mental Inversion swings
If you are trying to envision a forest valley front on you may find it hard. You must come at it with your peripheral vision. To do so don't push forwards all the time but invert your desire. Invert the forest valley so that everything air is now solid and everything solid is now air, you now have yourself an upside-down inside-out world. Now invert your vision back again and you will find you have made progress, the trees will have more leaves and there will be more diverse plants and colours, in short the level of detail and 'reality' will be increased.
To make yourself into a giant lizard god you must shrink yourself on each out breath and grow yourself on each in-breath. Body the size of a > dog> bear > mouse > elephant > ant > dinosaur > flea > whale > microbe > city > cell > country > molecule > ocean > atom > world > subatomic > solar system > string > galaxy.... a giant lizard god the size of a galaxy eating everything, other galaxies, becoming bigger and bigger until you encompass everything.

Multiplicity Soup
In order to put yourself in the best place to grow a new limb, a new building, a new forest or any structure. You may find it useful to dive into a multiplicity soup first. If you want a specific limb, first embody many other limbs in your mind, shapeshift your body in every way you can imagine and stretch yourself until you are more fluid. If you want wings, first embody a fish with scales and fins, an elephant's trunk, a triceratop's horns, the tail of a monkey. Feel your arms becoming spines of other animals. Feel multiple arms, multiple legs. And then explode your wings outward and look and you will see they are far more formed than at first, they are structured and detailed, fine and strong and responsive.

Physical Inversion Swings
Or, How you can prepare your physical and emotional body so that conceptually and spiritually you can go further and deeper and keep grounded.
Or, Inversion swings for maximum life bandwidth.
Rembrandt is the master of light by virtue of his overwhelming darkness.
We covered the mental swings of the imagination in the interview on page … however this concept permeates the mental, physical and spiritual. Inversion swings are performed constantly in all aspects of life. If we try to move constantly towards one end of the spectrum we lose our swinging momentum and we find ourselves being dragged back down by gravity towards a resting state. This applies to waking and sleeping, eating and fasting, anabolic and catabolic states of the body, and using the conscious and unconscious mind for directional visualisation. If we try to stay awake indefinitely we will become tired, If we rest all day we may have trouble sleeping. If we constantly are active we don't give our body time to repair. These are all examples of us trying to swing in only one direction. If we don't make the time to swing the other way for a while nature will find a way to bring us back to the central line somehow. Let's talk about how we can ride the waves and make use of the swings in our favour, growing a better body and clearing out old cells.
The natural state of the body is one of harmony and health and it also is a state that primes the body for imaginative insight. All of the processes that activate the Pineal gland and the third eye are also simultaneously going to support your hormonal optimisation. Shamanism is our birthright as humans.

Acute Stressors
Placing acute stressors on the body such as compound movements of resistance training and Cold and heat therapy can help to give the body the signal that it is alive and that it will need to continue to grow to adapt. Acute stressors as part of a natural swinging diurnal rhythm, will signal your natural hormones to increase. They will be released as we sleep and will reach their peak when we wake up. This can produce a drive to accomplish our goals through the day.
Momentarily swinging the body into states that push it beyond its boundaries, will keep the body and mind adapting and becoming stronger. Acute stress (a swing) is good and chronic stress (not swinging but stuck at one end of the spectrum) is bad. The ultimate physical swing is super intense activity and super deep rest: Acute stress is achieved by high-intensity training or sprinting for short periods rather than long runs/jogging. It is achieved effectively by lifting heavy weights and making sure you sleep well.
Dream(goal) > will power < consciousness
/
Inversion swings optimise and grow
/
Vessel = body mind spirit
Life is inversion swings, whether we are creating, imagining or reading. In reverie, or deep in the physical body.
Our being is made up of a physical, an emotional and a spiritual/intellectual/conceptual aspect. They often are linked together, so acute stressors are often exercises in will power that transfers to all three domains. And we move ourselves into different emotions and states of mind via our body.

SLEEP/WAKE
Deep sleep and high wake are best emphasised through exercise, light and food manipulation.
To sleep deeply we need some physical exercise in the day, we also need to get some sun or at least very intense light preferably in the morning to set our bio clock. It is best if you can sun gaze to get the most energy from the sun, and this can be done safely at sunrise and sunset. Only do what is comfortable, and enjoy the serotonin your body produces for you to celebrate the day.
Use calcium to contract your muscles and magnesium to relax them. Adequate calcium can be taken in through diet but to absorb it we need to get enough sun to produce Vitamin D. Magnesium can be bought in bulk as Epsom salt, then mixed one to one and applied to the body before bed. This is cheap and the body will absorb what it needs.

Fasting and Feeding
Your body produces cortisol naturally as we wake up, this is a good thing as it gives us energy for the day. As with all these things they are bad chronically but are essential in their appropriate acute placements. If you fast, or only eat fats and protein, refraining from carbohydrates during the morning you will find yourself in a more steady state of mental clarity. Eating carbohydrates at this time are more likely to be stored as fat anyway. (Sometimes gaining some fat can also be a good thing but mostly we do well to avoid it.) Instead consume proteins and fats and a coffee if you wish. Then eating your carbohydrates at the end of the day after a workout will refill glycogen stores in your muscles and give you an insulin spike which will help you build muscle. You should sleep well.
You want to have a fairly low GI through the day and then a spike around dinner, and you want high GI carbs so that the spike goes down while you are sleeping, as we produce growth hormone mostly at night when our GI levels go back down.
Going through periods of fasting can allow the body to detoxify and remove old cells, this includes dry fasting, water fasting, intermittent fasting, and zero carb diets. There is a sliding scale. You want periods of feast and famine to increase your body's receptivity to nutrients and continue to grow.
A day of fasting will increase your body's ability to use food to build muscle. Fasting will also put you in an alkaline state as will hyperventilating, which increases visions and interconnected thoughts.

Breathing swings
It can also be beneficial to swing your body to hyper oxygenated and high carbon dioxide levels, through hyperventilation and breath holds. The swing between carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs naturally during the night when we begin to breathe more deeply before our dreams. If we perform oxygenation swings during the day we find ourselves moving into a visionary state.
Just like heat, cold and exercise, temporary hyperventilation and hypoxia are acute stressors that generate strong adaptive reactions from the body. Increasing your heart rate variability and helps our circadian rhythm to optimise. Swinging in short periods of time between hyperventilation and Hypoxia, has a range of benefits including increasing the body's ability to produce and use energy. The Wim Hof breathing method sets a good amount of time between swings for optimising the health of your body and mind. Taking roughly 30 deep fast breaths and then holding your breath on the out breath, followed by and in breath hold. Then repeat the whole process 2 or more times for an increase in the swings. There is also an experiential journey you will take yourself on doing the breathing. The hyperventilation can feel like hard work, holding the outbreath can be a relief after this and further on in the hold there is an absent-minded-ness. Then the in-breath and hold can feel euphoric and visually stimulating, even hallucinogenic. Wim Hof suggests starting the day with the routine. I like to do it before bed as I go into a visual dream state and sleep deeply. You can also integrate this breathing into a workout, if you can find a way to do it safely as it will increase your VO2 max; the maximum oxygen you can use to fuel your energy output.

Sun Gazing - light swings
It is important to limit bright lights at night especially blue coloured light in order to signal melatonin to begin which in turn signals hormone production. These systems are all closely tied together. It is important then to get as much sun in winter as we can, and get plenty in summer too without burning ourselves. ideally we will sungaze at sunrise and sunset standing vertically with our feet in the soil. Then when the sun is at its Zenith we sunbathe horizontally, nude and for 10 minutes in summer and probably as much as you can get in winter, whenever the clouds clear.
Letting the sun enter our eyes helps our pineal and pituitary glands to regulate our hormones. The bright red and infrared light of sunrise and sunset feel great for the eyes, afterwards I feel a deep feeling of relaxation. The stimulation of the pineal gland helps to strengthen the biorhythm cutting down on the drowsy making melatonin in the day for a greater release at night and increasing serotonin. Infrared light is very healing for the body
If you get enough sun in the day your pineal gland will produce melatonin at night. This will help you sleep and dream deeply. Melatonin is only one molecule away from DMT, which is perhaps also produced by the pineal gland. The chemical structure is only differentiated by DMT having one more oxygen molecule, which may explain why we begin to breathe more deeply and quickly at the start of a rapid eye movement dream sleep cycle.

Sun Bathing
UVB rays get the body to produce vitamin D. UVA rays are associated with melanoma and DNA damage. We want to balance our UVA with UVB as much as possible. UVB rays are strongest at midday whereas UVA rays are highest in midmorning and afternoon.
Also most sun creams only block UVB rays, you wont get vitamin D as easily and you will also not realise that you are getting too much non-tanning rays such as UVA.
You want to be fully nude so that you produce the most vitamin D for the amount of time you spend in the sun.
Blackout at night followed by light at dawn will give your body clock the diurnal swing it needs to produce serotonin in the day and melatonin for sleeping, and DMT for dreaming and other hormones such as healthy cortisol in the morning and testosterone at night.
Eat the sun and let the night eat you.
[image of a body filled with light in a void of darkness illuminating some objects vaguely around them]

Heat and cold
If you have an ice bath an hour or so before bed you can help yourself go into a deeper sleep by supporting the body's natural swing towards cooler at night.
Ice baths and hot saunas provide the body with an acute stress that requires you only to remain still, you can push your body quite far this way and get a good swing as once you are in a sauna or ice bath it requires inaction to remain there, rather than sprinting or working out.

Exercise
For exercise you want the highest intensity possible to produce the highest peak of catabolic stress in order that your body will super compensate. Lifting weights is the best thing you can do for this, using compound movements such as squats, bench press and deadlifts that recruit the most muscles and move the most weight. If you're not lifting weights you can sprint with full intensity for a minute and then lay down and rest for 4 or 5 minutes. Then repeat 2 or 3 more times and you're done. You have only worked out for 3 or 4 minutes in total but if you have given it your all it will be enough.
This acute stressor will help you to sleep at night, and will also stimulate the release of natural hormones.

Recoverability
It is important to note that with many of these swings you will need to start slowly, each swing must be within your body's ability to recover from. Over time the body will build up a resistance and you can push it further. This is true for training volume, sun exposure, cold exposure and heat exposure. It also requires less will power to commit to smaller changes that can build over time. If you overreach on your recoverability you will get sick or injure yourself. To know if you are overreaching see "Heart Rate Variability" on page ...

Emotional swings
Emotional bandwidth holds a gamut of emotions and feelings that can be felt deeply if we can only give ourselves the time, and the simultaneous detachment to safely experience them. If we have enough perspective we are able to find beauty in all emotions, ie melancholie and sadness. Healthy emotional swings give us a wide experience of life. Why do we find movies so enjoyable? It is because of the emotional swings they cause, with the detachment of being a viewer. Enjoy the movie of your life, and find the pleasure and beauty of sensation in all its peaks and valleys.

Anxiety Swings
When we talk about modern anxiety we almost always mean chronic anxiety. To escape this we actually can benefit from some acute anxiety. Both in the form of physical acute stressors but also by spending some time to consciously investigate what we are anxious about. In other words we actually need to swing further into anxiety or rather the subjects that are causing our anxiety in order to swing back the other direction into a calm and relaxed state. One way to do this can be journaling and list making. Often journaling helps us separate our circle of concern from our circle of influence, and hopefully will leave us realising what we can and can't change. We make an acute expression of our anxieties, and can let them go, just as exercise may help an agitated body to sleep at night. Other emotions we may regard as ugly can also be regarded as gifts to be transformed. Jealousy and anger can both be used as motivation, and pain is often dissipated or transformed once we bring the shining light of consciousness onto it.

Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
A great biomarker for health is our HRV. The heart naturally has a variation in the rate at which it beats, if we are healthy it will speed up on our in breath and slow down on our out breath. As we do this we move between the sympathetic autonomic nervous system on the in breath and the parasympathetic ANS on the out breath. If we are unhealthy and in a state of constant anxiety we won't have the variability in our heart rate.
There is a natural resting breath rate of about 6 breaths per minute. We can regulate our breath to this speed and if we do so we will optimise the coherence between our breathing and our HRV. If we measure our HRV in the morning after waking up we get an idea of how well our HRV and our parasympathetic ANS is performing. And if we do this everyday we can recognise trends and adjust accordingly. If we are seeing a downward trend in HRV we might be over stressing ourselves and should try to increase sleep or take a rest day from working out. If we are seeing an upwards trend we could benefit from adding some more temporary stressors such as intensity to our workouts, we would then see a temporary decrease in HRV but we would be increasing our HRV long term, which is the more important value.
HRV will alert us to overreaching days or weeks before an increasing resting heart rate or other symptoms will let us know something is wrong.
Many of the physical inversion swings mentioned in this article will increase HRV, such as deep sleeping/working out, light dark swings, etc.
Hope gratitude and love will increase your HRV and Anxiety and anger will decrease it. If we are aware we are anxious or angry, reducing and controlling our breath rate will help us to move out of this mental state and raise our HRV again bringing coherence to our in and out breath, and balancing our yin yang forces.
YINYANGParasympathetic ANSSympathetic ANSBreathe outBreath inRecover rest digestFight or flightsleepwakeanaboliccatabolic
There can be times when we want a low HRV, when we want to be in fight or flight, during an intense weight lift or to sprint 100m. In this case we may benefit from increasing our breath rate especially shortening the duration of our outbreath. We will move our body into a Sympathetic ANS state.

Meditation Swings
The great thing about meditation is that it increases our awareness and our feeling of being a witness. This consciousness can then carry over into the rest of our life, and help give us perspective on our emotions.
In meditation itself we move away from the business of the mind, perhaps from the emotional states we have been in chronically for a while. And interestingly it is in that state of emptiness that imagination can enter most strongly, we may become visionary and hallucinogenic. Which is perhaps the natural state of the mind that we allow petty chronic states to cloud. It is the swing to empty that gets the most full.
Removal of stimulus in many sensations will lead to a compensatory hallucination as our brain swings to its natural state of pattern interpretation. We can put ourselves in darkness or uniform brightness of a snow storm or by creating a mask that blocks all vision but creates a uniform field of light. And we can do it aurally by listening to white noise. Eating snow may also be a good way to imagine tastes. A sensory deprivation tank combines many of these sensation blankets and is great to use when you have the chance.

Reverse Meditation Swing
There is a reverse meditation you can do. Instead of trying to reach a state of pure awareness, which may lead to spontaneous inspirations and imaginative thoughts. we can instead try to imagine something, which may lead to spontaneous states of pure awareness. In other words the spaces when we do not receive our imaginative request can be filled with a non-thought as we wait for our imagination to take hold.

Physical Emotional and conceptual realms
We have talked about the physical and now the emotional, but there is also a conceptual/spiritual realm in which to use inversion swings. All of the realms influence each other. There are several ways of categorising these realms such as locating the physical at our reptilian brain, the emotional at our mammalian brain and the conceptual at our neo cortex. Or we divide it as: willing feeling and thinking. Or belly, heart and head.
The heart gives us our emotional bandwidth, it is our capacity to recognise beauty. And to find pleasure in the world. It is our enjoyment.
The Head realm should have razor sharp clarity and deep imagination. It is a sharp knife of consciousness that may also swing into an unconscious reverie of imagination.
In Chi Gong these realms are stacked in a pyramid shape. And each lower realm must be wider than the next one so that the structure is stable. If we are too much in our head without a foundation of connection to our body we may topple over.
We want a physical vessel that can create its own chemistry for emotional and spiritual bandwidth. A healthy energized vessel gaining energy from the sun and physical connection to the earth.

Conceptual Swings
Expanding the mind is an exercise in conceptual swings. We come across new concepts and pieces of information and we have to find a way to fit them into our existing network. Often we are presented with multiple truths that seem at odds with one another. Or our picture of the world will not fit with another person's viewpoint. These simultaneous contrasting truths and viewpoints are opportunities for growth. Simultaneous contrast is an outcome of any linking of concepts as everything is in a way both a contradiction of all other things and is also the same as all other things. The most linking of concepts we can have could be described as a hallucinogenic experience. Pattern recognition then is the backbone of the simultaneous contrast, Or the inversion swing.
Just as in the emotional realm we become healthy when we can witness various truths without becoming reactionary. We need to be able to come across an idea or another viewpoint and be able to find value in it. And more importantly to find beauty in it. Because just like in the emotional realm beauty is our yard stick.
If we can hold on to a contrasting concept we may eventually unify it into our network and become larger.
