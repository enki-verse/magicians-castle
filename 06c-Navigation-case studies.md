# Navigation - Case Studies in Active Imagination

## Active Imagination Case Studies

### Julie Heffernan

Julie Heffernan is a contemporary practitioner of active imagination. She doesn't directly use the phrase active imagination, but she does talk of her discovery and subsequent use of image streaming. Her image streaming forms one side of an active imagination dialogue that makes up her practice. Each vision (old man of the sea) is captured and put down on the canvas then she listens to her dream self to tell her what the next step is. Sometimes she will begin with a mechanised reproduction of an image idea, however the construction of this image becomes a "frottage" onto which she may search out dreams.

She describes first discovering the technique in a hypnagogic state following a long day of painting: "I was painting for twelve hours a day….exhausted, I shut my eyes and went into a relaxed state. Suddenly I started to see pictures pouring into my head." she had discovered another world that benefited her practice immensely. Eventually, she moved on from her initial unplanned technique of exhaustion, and now simply begins the painting with a first layer of paint, which she now has the ability to feed to her subconscious and allow for a response. Her method is to continue the dialogue between the created image and her inner image stream. "It's really fun to paint this way. A lot of people start with a drawing but I think it kills the process. Each character walks on into my conscious mind" giving the character the stream into her agency allows them to come to life, and thus she is able to begin a dialogue with them.

Active imagination facilitates the union of opposites. This brings about peace on earth. Our environment will respond in kind to our vibration. Once we unify our opposites, the conscious and the unconscious, the mycelium and the mushroom, our reality will become heaven on earth.

Successfully surrealism applies active imagination to the imaginal realm.

Heffernan is very aware that she wants to also construct the painting spatially. She has a discipline that is able to hold her visions. She is a successful surrealist, and that is not a title that can be applied often, since its inception those designated as surrealists have mostly failed either not really finding the limitless nature of the imagination or more likely not finding a discipline that will balance their dreams and allow a dialogue. A main problem with surrealism is the falling into stereotypes. This comes about by imposing theories such as Freudian analysis on the vision and directing it according to that logic. The reality of the imagination is complete in itself. We should not interpret it with any theory. Take the reality of the Imaginal realm as it is, and question the various forces so that they may respond. Max Ernst was semi successful in escaping this trap through his use of frottage, which often allowed for a break away from Freudian setups, I believe he genuinely allowed the other dimension to enter in this way.

Dreams exist in a different realm of logic. if we can enter into this logic, and accept it as real. Further truths may unfold to us. To use active imagination we have to accept unconscious dreams as just as real as the outer world.

Conversely we can attack surrealism from the other side, not only must the public and private be just as real, but they must be seen as the same substance. Furthermore this substance must be seen as smoke and mirrors, or Maya. A similar sentiment is shown in the work of Jung. He says to accept the imaginary as just as real but then to see through the visions as Maya. And ergo see through the exterior world as Maya.

## Alchemy (Example of Active Imagination)

*(different to navigation but similar to making a fantasy into true imagination. it is an apollonian navigation.)*

*(Alchemy and simultaneous contrast are both still active imagination. when they pick something that isn't currently joined conceptually they are breaking the small self. and then they look to re-embody and make beautiful.)*

At the outset we can say that nothing is off limits to the imagination. It is completely up to the individual where they would focus their beam of attention as whichever part we perceive, we see an image of the whole. David Bohm and Leonard Susskind suggest a theory that everything we experience in the universe as 3d reality is a projection from a 2d surface at the edge of the universe. Much like the predicted information that is contained on the horizon of the black hole. However I am pushing their metaphor further, as a major characteristic of Holograms is that if they are cut in half both halves will still produce a full image but at a lower resolution. All we lose as we look at smaller and smaller parts is the degree of resolution. If we join holographic fragments together we generate further resolution and an expansion of consciousness.

One of the lenses for the development of the castle is Alchemy, a practice of participation between matter and thought. Which is intimately linked to Gnosticism, Shamanism, Witchcraft, Magic, and other Occult practices. The oldest of these is shamanism, which views animals as having spirits; it is animistic, and sometimes this animism is extended to plants and all matter, giving all of nature an agency. As we move back in time the disciplines become more and more unified, science philosophy, art magic and medicine all combine under Alchemy and shamanism.

Gnosticism by contrast is relatively more separated from science, and concerned mainly with divine knowledge, associated with God and the bible including apocryphal texts. Alchemy remains concerned with physical matter and science relatively late in the game, well into the rational age in the western world; the alchemist is a philosophical protagonist (it's a sort of gentleman's shamanism, hehe). It could very much be seen as Barfield's Final Participation.

We can look for parallels in the work of Goethean science as developed by Steiner, to shine a light on what this tradition might look like. And we can look to McKenna for a contemporary lens on practicing alchemy. These ideas can be seen in Fictocriticism, which places the subjective experience of the anthropologist or essayist as central, generating imaginings and images of subjects, as a way of understanding.

It's very strange that in primary and high school we are taught to write an essay as a repetitive statement, the introduction, main body and conclusion must all repeat themselves, and we are given this image as the only essay form. Looking back at the origin of the essay Montaigne would write an essay that wandered and roamed, moving from observations of society, to philosophical musings, and ponderings of his daily bodily functions; in final participation even excrement is uplifted. Montaigne's writings are an example of integrating the bodily and the experiential, with the philosophical. The human is at the heart of experience.

Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy roughly translates to Knowledge of the nature of man. Anthroposophy's scope encompasses all existence, and so we see that it is the study of the human in all things. Before publishing esoteric theosophical and Anthroposophical writings, Steiner was asked to edit Goethe's writings on Nature. Steiner was inspired by Goethe's way of thinking, viewing it as a solution to the problems he found reading contemporary philosophy, particularly the epistemological problems generated by Kant. He wrote his first book *The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception*, and this was to become a foundation stone for his spiritual fields of enquiry, which he felt Goethe had left the door open to.

Goethe and following him Steiner are making a step towards a re-unifying Final participation, in 1921 Steiner gave a lecture saying: People think of natural phenomena so entirely apart from man that they are tending ever more and more to disregard the human being in their study of the phenomena of Nature. He, on the contrary, believed that natural phenomena only reveal their true meaning if they are regarded in full connection with man — with the whole organization of man. In saying this, Goethe pointed to a method of research, which is well nigh anathematized nowadays. People today seek an 'objective' understanding of Nature through research that is completely separated from the human being. This is particularly noticeable in such a science as Astronomy, where no account at all is taken of the human being.

For Goethe knowledge was about association, rather than separation, dare we say Hallucinogenic? (Psychedelic experience is commonly reported to increase meaningfulness and connection between all things.) Certainly rejecting the Cartesian-Newtonian method's inherent split of observer and observed. Goethe wanted a living interaction with nature, the task of the scientist was to enter into the living essence of the plant and discover its "Ur-phenomena" its underlying archetypal pattern, which is something he saw as clearly objective and not subjective. Often these Ur-phenomena are best discovered through a comparison and an energised linking of diverse phenomena, to bridge diversity forms and activities we use morphology. This can be applied between species or simply to the movement within a single animal plant or organism. We often get to Ur-phenomena through observation of the movement between states.

Morphology can be found in many scientific breakthroughs along with Goethe's. When Newton saw the apple fall and then looked at the moon and asked why it didn't appear to be falling or if perhaps it was also falling. He was trying to discover an essence that both these objects held, and how this essence might be morphed through changes in density etc. In other words the essence of morphology is unity. Other discoveries morph diverse phenomena, such as the electromagnetic-force connecting magnetism and electricity, or the unification of space-time under general relativity. String theory is a unified theory (all theories are unifying but none have gotten as far as this), which attempts to find an underlying force that may morph into the other forces (electro-magnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and gravity). Goethean science is said to go beyond straight science by being participatory and imaginative as opposed to dissociative and separate. By bringing the being in the world nature of the observer into the equation.

Steiner had a lot of fun pushing this imaginative science to its limits: We would feel sick and unhealthy if we were to approach nature, looking up into the world of stars, with only the calculating vision of the astronomers, and if we then allowed these dead thoughts to sink into the world; we would feel sick and the sickness would be unto death. But if we let Christ accompany us, if we carry our dead thoughts in the presence of Christ into the world of stars, into the world of the sun, of the moon, of the clouds, mountains, rivers, minerals, plants, and animals, into the whole physical world of man, then in our vision of nature everything comes alive… The entire earth becomes a kind of "book of life" that enlightens us about the human world, the world in which we live, the world of human souls.

We have to find living as opposed to dead images, ones that can give a conceptual and emotional force to the movements of the galaxy, the arteries, and the nervous system. Steiner brings Christ into it as an image representing the human. For Steiner the incarnation of Christ was a pivot point in the evolution of consciousness, signalling the ego or the "I" entering into the human, which is the meaning of the earth, "the world of human souls". So Christ in this sense is an archetypal image of the human at our current stage of evolution.

In Jeffrey Jerome Cohen's book *Stone*, he argues against anthropocentrism. Cohen takes up the mantle of the earth, and imbues it once more with agency. He joins a growing number of ecologists that believe anthropocentrism is disastrous, and suggests that if we could shift our understanding to the geographical time of stones and mountains, we can escape our separation from the environment, and our exploitation of the earth. However, I would argue that anthropocentrism is unavoidable, it is a necessary part of thought as humans; we are and always will be at the centre of our thoughts, what is more we are our thoughts in as much as we are a conscious ego. And if we are to say that anthropocentrism is simply a matter of the human body as valued above all else, then true anthropocentrism would take tremendous care of the environment as a necessary platform that holds up human life. I think a better future doesn't lie in escaping the human, it lies in extending the human, as far as we can push it, into animals, plants, and rocks, into molecules. Anthropomorphism is an extension of thought and ego into the very earth. It has only been during a relatively narrow period of human history that we have relegated our consciousness to our body, to our brain. Transcendence has been sacrificed for Immanence

## Simultaneous Contrast (Example of Active Imagination)

> "The opposite of a fact is falsehood, but the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth." — Niels Bohr

Simultaneous contrast would have to be a gravitator for the castle, a truth is never content to be left standing on its own with no opposition to keep it healthy. Roland Barthes' Punctum, Gristle for the mill and so forth.

The best thought images are often created through a juxtaposition of incongruences; interpreters of the surrealists are generally too eager to relegate imagery to Freudian symbols, or symbolic stories ("NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT THINKING; YOU'RE JUST BEING LOGICAL." Bohr), whereas a truly energized surrealist painting could not be compartmentalized in this way. In my own paintings I would like a continual bubbling up; for a conceptual binaural beat to occur. Symbolist art is also a tremendous attraction, but it is successful not through surface symbols, but through an insistence on deeper symbols, and an invitation to the viewer to keep on looking in the hope they might get somewhere. A deep symbol is a thought form. A thought form is often a hallucinogenic structure that is visual, we cannot read it per se, we rather know from it, it speaks to us but not as a voice. Here is an example of an experience I had: After reading and studying the apocalypse according to St. John it was getting quite late so I went to bed, I closed my eyes and tried to shift towards an imaginative state to call forth sleep. As I did so I saw pulsating forms and patterns, and I knew that these were visions of the text I had been reading, strange alien choreographies and Escher-esque morphing forms. This was a vision of the astral world, in which an alchemical force was shaping new forms for me, so that they might produce the music necessary for my etheric body.

Terrence McKenna identifies strongly with Alchemy. He talks about its characteristics as alchemical/mercury thought and the union of opposites, the search for the philosopher's stone; the universal panacea, and the spiritual self-transformational process that is a dual aspect of creating the philosopher's stone. McKenna sees the first through to the fourth century, as similar to our own, in that there is an atmosphere of despair and exhaustion. It was during this time that the Hermetic Corpus was developed: "[The] Hermetic Corpus is the most poetic and cleanly expressed outpouring of ancient knowledge that we possess…it is essentially a religion of the redemption of the earth through magic." In Alchemy this is achieved through a series of processes, this is called The Great Work, where substance is taken and refined, through calcination, dissolution, separation, conjunction, fermentation, distillation and coagulation. The alchemic substance being transformed is at once physical and spiritual, so that the great work is a transformation of ourselves. To be an alchemist is a dreamlike matter, we must take on alchemical thinking, we must embody mercury, that metal which can flow freely and take on the form of any vessel, mirroring the situation that it finds itself in through its liquid metal surface. Mercury flows like the droplet of the yin yang, and it is S shaped surface between the yin and yang that is the most important aspect to understand; in this instance mercury is the flowing boundary between waking and sleeping "where you can project the contents of the unconscious and you can read it back to yourself". Alchemy, like hermeneutics as above so below, gives us a picture of the human in the microcosm and the macrocosm. But furthermore it contains its own antipathy "alchemical thinking is thinking that is always antithetical", it forms a union of opposites, like the archetypal hermaphrodite, between masculine and feminine, soul and Luna, Mercury and Sulphur. This antithetical thinking sits at the outskirts of rational thought: it is pre-rational and post-rational. To reach it we must move into dreams and thought-images that may carry us beyond 1 = 1.

## Unification

Coleridge navigates the mindscape by differentiating between primary imagination, secondary imagination and fantasy. Primary imagination is this human experience we are having, that we call existence. secondary imagination.

> "The primary imagination I hold to be the living power and prime agent of all human perception, and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite 'I am'. The secondary I consider as an echo of the former, co-existing with the conscious will, yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency, and differing only in degree and in the mode of its operation. It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate; or where this process is rendered impossible, yet still, at all events, it struggles to idealize and to unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead'

So coleridge says we should navigate by idealising and unifying, in an essentially vital process.

## The Dark Water (Tolkien Case Study)

Tolkien's *Hobbit*, *The Lord of the Rings* and the *Silmarillion* are three of his major books that all depict Middle Earth. Within this realm there is a book that is written by Bilbo and Frodo, they record their adventures and history (Hobbit and LoTR), and Bilbo also translates Elvish History (Silmarillion). This book is called the Red Book of Westmarch. And Tolkien's books are all translations of this Red Book. It Just so happens that the periods of Tolkien and Jung's Red Books line up. In 1913 they both began their visionary/imaginary experiences. Without knowledge of each other's work they both developed a Red book with profound similarities. The heart of the hobbit could be said to be Bilbo's Descent into the caves of the misty mountains, where he comes to an underground lake and finds the ring on a rock. Jung's initial embrace of his visions brought on a similar descent into an underground chamber in which he also finds a jewel.

Furthermore Jung and Tolkien both have visions of floods. Jung's vision of a wave of blood engulfing Europe came to him in 1913, and Tolkien had recurring dreams of apocalyptic floods from early childhood. For Tolkien these dreams were Atlantean, and he brought them into middle earth under the name Numenor. After Numenor sinks back down into the sea a colony is created in Gondor, much like the stories of Egypt as a remnant from atlantis. Tolkien also wrote two more science fiction books. *The Lost Road* and the *Notion Club Papers*. C S Lewis and Tolkien dared each other to write a time travel novel. Lewis wrote *That Hideous Strength* and Tolkien wrote his unfinished *The Lost Road*. Tolkien then ten years later wrote *The Notion Club Papers* which includes a version of the Inklings in Oxford and even begins with a discussion of "That Hideous Strength". Tolkien's *Notion Club Papers* are a quirky and unconventional masterpiece. The first half of the book is pure literary discussion between the renamed Inklings on the nature of the imaginary. The second half moves into more plot drawing on reincarnating individuals from Atlantis that show up at different points in history along with dreams and astral travel in which a few of the characters move through time and space and even into other "dimensions" such as the mythic dimension. Tolkien here was attempting to weave together many reverberations of the myth of Atlantis. However as fate would have it Tolkien's Publisher Stanley Unwin insisted that Tolkien devote his energy to a sequel to the Hobbit instead. In the *Notion club papers* Tolkien imagines a huge storm in 1987, and incredibly there really was a storm in England only a couple of months from when Tolkien had "predicted" it, known as "The Great Storm" it was the largest in 300 years. My Parents and grandparents still remember the devastation, the ancient oak trees that had been torn up by their roots and how people were literally crying for these ancient trees. I'm sure Tolkien would have been crying too.

## Walpurgisnacht

**Rembrandt:** An image is a moment in time. Luminosity is a product of darkness and a strict hierarchy of tonal shifts. All that glitters is not gold. Gold has value from its rarity.

**Constable:** life is fractal; the universe has an infinite number of centres. Every acorn is a gem that may birth a forest. The true human vision isn't a snapshot. It is a wandering and a meandering through time.

**Claude Lorrain:** in order to capture the light we must darken it. Pour mud over it. Without the lens of darkness I am overwhelmed by the light. I am seduced by it and I can no longer seduce. My power is given away in my enjoyment.

**Hockney:** mind shifts between perspectives as it sees fit. Sees fit. The fitness of sight. Healthy sight is one that is free to move in all directions of consciousness. It isn't restricted to a single dimension that might cause tennis elbow or secretarial lower back pain.

**Turner:** The debate comes down to the properties of light. Are you Newtonian or Goethean? Colours arise at the boundary of light and dark. Darkness has its own force and is not simply an absence. it can be an opacity that will shield or reflect. Like the atmosphere that red shifts the sunset. Newton's light is that of the camera. It has only one dimension. Goethe's light and dark embraces the lived experience of light.

**Dali:** light is the point of penetration. The refractions and reflections that enable perception are the crucifixion of Christ. Everything you look at becomes pinned like a butterfly. It is nailed to the cross, it is the sacrifice of incarnation, the crystallisation that makes the individual ego possible and bridles the infinite. To remain with the infinite is where I fall in love. I spend many hours with the white canvas, the field of olive leaves, or the darkness of my bed. And it is at these times that I see Christ as the Child. The infinite is not yet fixed to the cross.

**Michelle Ussher:** mythology is a palette. it runs in rivulets of paint, it can be mixed and daubed with wild abandon. Just as the notes may produce memories and awaken, it may also lullaby. It pays to sleep also. As where has it all come from but darkness? The yellows of the dawn, recapitulate at sunset.

**Ernst Fuchs:** a thousand rubies. a thousand tears. The diamond net wraps us all. And it is with infinite sadness, the joy of the one that is always awake, that the void has been torn asunder. The birth pangs of godhood.
