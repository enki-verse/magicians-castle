# Immortality

## Transforming the Castle Beyond Death

It is possible that we restructure our castle so that it cannot die, so that our ego may continue to live until we are satisfied with our embodiment of infinite being. This is the logical potential of potentiation. We have to create a castle that will not be torn apart by the forces of darkness at death; by the infinite being that is our mother. It is all too easy to let go of our ego and return to unity with source, and this is only desirable for some individuals. So here we are talking about the ego in the Egyptian sense rather than the Buddhist sense. The Egyptian book of the dead reveals how the ego that can be prepared with spells and knowledge of names of beings in the psychic realm in order that it might pass through it and become a god.

The rejection of complete dissolution into infinite being is a negation; we are saying no to something. There are mixed opinions as to whether this is preferable. But some may take the approach that to live fully is to live forever. The Kabbalists see negativity as "the essential manifestation of the primal will". The name for primal will is Keter, it is a "darkness which is at the same time the source of all light." Keter's negativity gives light and existence to all the other sefirot and at the same time it is "delight and desire". It is a primal delight and desire that is at the heart of creation. For the yes of creation to come into being it has to say no. Leading on from this we could see the dissolution of the ego as essentially anti-creation. We have to say no to it if we want creative consciousness to continue.

## Preparing the Castle for Death

Using the Tibetan book of the dead and consciousness building exercises it is possible that a wizard may be able to "live" beyond the death of the physical body and maintain some perspective. The Magician must prepare the castle for submersion if it is his/her wish to maintain their agency. He/she will have to equip the castle with various talismans to hold the castle together as the forces of the great mother (infinite being) surround it.

## Integrating the Opposites

The next important step is to embrace the other. We have to integrate the masculine and the feminine. In other words we must have a strong enough order to hold chaos inside ourselves. Otherwise we will be overwhelmed by exterior chaos. In Blake's *Milton* he outlines the death and void outside of existence that if we enter into will destroy us. Our "Human power" i.e Individual human relationships can sustain contentions and splits but the eroticism of the mind cannot sustain such a split. The split leads to death. Unification of the "six-fold [multiplistic] Miltonic Female" leads to immortality. The separated light of awareness is masculine and the infinite life force is feminine. If we do not integrate this multiplicity then "thou goest to Eternal Death"

Milton paints a scene where the multiplistic feminine principle is first exploded out from ourselves in a diversifying force before being reintegrated with our conscious self. As a "Garment dipped in blood" around the limbs of Jesus. The imagination around the ego.

> the Virgin divided Six-fold & with a shriek
> Dolorous that ran thro all Creation a Double Six-fold Wonder!
> Away from Ololon she divided & fled into the depths
> Of Milton's Shadow as a Dove upon the stormy Sea.
> 
> Then as a Moony Ark Ololon descended to Felphams Vale
> In clouds of blood, in streams of gore, with dreadful thunderings
> Into the Fires of Intellect that rejoiced in Felphams Vale
> Around the Starry Eight: with one accord the Starry Eight became
> One Man Jesus the Saviour. wonderful! round his limbs
> The Clouds of Ololon folded as a Garment dipped in blood
> Written within & without in woven letters: & the Writing
> Is the Divine Revelation in the Literal expression:
> A Garment of War, I heard it named the Woof of Six Thousand Years"

As Jesus wears the cloak of death he is the unification and the redemption of death. Jesus becomes immortal because he has embraced the double six-fold feminine. The "clouds of blood (Ololon), in streams of gore"

To embrace life fully is to accept its physicality in its gory detail. Gore as lust and the sexual unification of flesh in the landscape of embodiment.

## Annihilating the Negation

> "Obey thou the Words of the Inspired Man
> All that can be annihilated must be annihilated
> 
> That the Children of Jerusalem may be saved from slavery
> There is a Negation, & there is a Contrary
> The Negation must be destroyed to redeem the Contraries
> The Negation is the Spectre; the Reasoning Power in Man
> This is a false Body: an Incrustation over my Immortal
> Spirit; a Selfhood, which must be put off & annihilated alway
> To cleanse the Face of my Spirit by Self-examination.
> 
> To bathe in the Waters of Life; to wash off the Not Human
> I come in Self-annihilation & the grandeur of Inspiration
> To cast off Rational Demonstration by Faith in the Saviour
> To cast off the rotten rags of Memory by Inspiration
> To cast off Bacon, Locke & Newton from Albions covering
> To take off his filthy garments, & clothe him with Imagination
> To cast aside from Poetry, all that is not Inspiration"

If you wish to be saved from slavery you will have to annihilate what "must be annihilated". To become the Child again, the creative yes being. William Blake shows us the way.

## The Body Transformation Process

*(transforming our structure, perhaps astral, etheric and physical, so that it serves the magician. and at a certain point we can control re-incarnation etc.)*

To live fully is to accept embodiment in its profuse expanse. The garment of blood that must be worn. This is not about escaping the body but about transforming it—transforming the physical, etheric, and astral bodies so that they serve the Magician rather than bind it.

> "first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul is to be expunged". 

Know that the masculine is not distinct from the feminine and unify them. "The whole creation will be consumed and appear infinite and holy…by an improvement of sensual enjoyment." We will come back to these ideas in Eroticism / Orgasmysticism.

When we transform our lower bodies with consciousness, we begin to control our own reincarnation. We become capable of carrying our flowering ego through death and rebirth, maintaining continuity of consciousness. This is the true meaning of immortality—not the endless continuation of a single lifetime, but the conscious evolution through multiple cycles of embodiment.

The castle must be built strong enough to withstand submersion into the infinite ocean of Mind at Large. It must have enough structure, enough differentiation, enough love woven into its foundations that it doesn't simply dissolve back into the primordial soup.

## Immortality as Creative Affirmation

The path to immortality is not one of denial or escape, but of radical affirmation. It is saying YES to embodiment, YES to differentiation, YES to the creative unfolding of consciousness through matter. It is choosing to remain as a distinct voice in the cosmic conversation rather than dissolving back into silence.

This is why we must find meaningful movements and embodiments to support the worlds we wish to create. Like the great cathedrals, paradigms, and rituals of the past, we must cast our visions into being. We reclaim the power of mythology, visionary art and ritual movement and all forms of integrated spiritual material, and use them to give ourselves the power of the gods—to be creators of our own reality.

You may read this and question our sanity, but we assure you we have clear eyes. We know we cannot fly..... but a time is coming soon when we can.

## Author's Notes

This chapter represents a divergence from both materialist denial of consciousness continuation and spiritual traditions that seek dissolution of the individual ego. Instead, it proposes a third path: the conscious evolution and preservation of individuated consciousness through death and beyond. This is not ego in the pathological sense of the "monkey mind" but the flowering of the true Self, the Magician.

The question remains: Is immortality desirable? For those who answer yes, who wish to continue the creative unfolding of consciousness, who say YES to embodiment and differentiation—this path is offered. For those who wish to dissolve back into the infinite—that path remains open as well. The choice itself is an expression of freedom.
