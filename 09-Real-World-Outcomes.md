# Real-World Outcomes

> "We should live as if the apocalypse has already occurred and will happen again." — Terrence McKenna

How should we expand our castle, and the society of all castles, to its full potential? so that we may question Infinite Being, become living, really incarnate fully, and become a creator, a magician? We will need both chaos and order in order that we may facilitate the next apocalypse, the next evolution of consciousness.

|  | Chaotic | Un-chaotic |
|---|---|---|
| **Ordered** | Creative | Tyranny |
| **Dis-ordered** | Anarchy | Zombie |

The goal of life is to expand consciousness for all beings, this is what we call freedom. Dis-integrated consciousness finds systems to help itself find freedom. We could call this system ordered chaos. Some dis-integrated consciousness become pathological, in their quest for freedom they may use too little order or too little chaos. There are 4 basic outcomes on a chaos order axis. Tyrannical order is too extreme and fixed, it cannot integrate new chaos. anarchists have too little order to hold the amount of chaos they would like. Zombies have neither enough chaos or order. order accumulates power and chaos expands the possibilities of how we can use it. A consciousness will see itself as the centre of the scale between anarchy and tyranny, that is the nature of pathology, otherwise they would be able to correct themselves. A creative has the ability to create and to share this with others. A consciousness has the ability to impinge on the freedom of another consciousness in proportion to its power. So the struggles we see playing out over and over in mythology, politics and science fiction are between tyranny and creative individuals.

*(Facilitating the apocalypse/utopia)*

I also would like to do my part to increase the speed at which we head towards the singularity of complexity. As I would say it is the evolution of consciousness and the flowering of love. To love is to know. So the intent is talismanic integral art, of unified complexity.

Covid has certainly increased the multiple possible realities that exist in simultaneous contrast. Most people have to choose a side and stay there. However there may be multiple truths existent.

So there is a yearning for the apocalypse/utopia. These are the same thing. We are moving towards strangeness. Which is at once nauseating and orgasmic. Of course I would like to embody love but everything always contains its opposite. Consider the sexual act which is so bodily, our bodies confront us with their blood and guts. Some people are fearful of sex for this reason and have developed defence mechanisms and psychoses; they do not accept the physical side of sex.

## ART

### Enkiverse (a manifesto)

**ENKIVERSE** takes its name from Enki, a forerunner of Prometheus, who gave humanity the keys to elevate ourselves to the position of gods.

**Enki-Verse = A song of the universe which unlocks, unfurls and blossoms mind.**

The Enkiverse is an ever expanding psycho-spatial artworld mythology encompassing the artistic practice of Zed

> The fine art of painting, which is the bastard of alchemy, always has been and always will be, a game. The rules of the game are quite simple: in a given arena, on as many psychic fronts as the talent allows, one must visually describe, the center of the meaning of existence. — Brett Whiteley

If we had to choose a term to describe Enkiverse it would be Visionary. This term has the attitude of expanding reality beyond the material realm. It is in effect bringing mind into matter. It contains fields such as sci-fi and eroticism within it. Also the psychic landscape which contains romanticism. All of this is embodied. These are forms which are graspable to human comprehension. Meaning provoking. Unlocking meaning.

In terms of medium Enkiverse uses many forms: painting, video, performance, words etc

Video is arguably a more evocative art form; the aesthetic seduction quickly unlocks our emotions. However so far ENKIVERSE has had the most success with painting to generate circus troupes of avatars. The art form of painting allows for a creation process that can contain plenty of feedback loops. It is built on a series of movements like going for a long walk, digging a hole, or building a pyramid out of bricks. This can allow for plenty of revision at every point, and for mind to reveal itself. It's messy, muddy, physical and alchemical. So plenty to be betting on within terms of embodiment of active imagination

### Visionary art

Visionary art usually defines a relatively narrow period beginning with Ernst Fuchs and flourishing into the psychedelic revolution. It often overlaps with psychedelic art. Most art in any area is drab, and stereotypical, and psychedelic and visionary art are no different. However if we are to use these terms correctly, visionary and psychedelic by definition would be highly original. They look beyond what is known and expand the psyche. As such stylistic recognisability is hard to define and is antithetical to visionary art. When we use the term in this way we can look back through time and find that all the really great art is visionary.

### Sci-fi

The Science fiction genre allows for the greatest expansion of consciousness. The greatest possibility to create links. It allows complete freedom to draw on any source, embracing fantasy, the "real" world, the distant future, mythology, aliens, magic, time travel, spirituality etc.

I think what we are really talking about here though is that my paintings are figurative and that they may even have a narrative, which has been mostly absent from recent popular painting. Why not integrate the rich realm of narrative? I suppose I have gravitated towards a sci-fi picture style as it is in line with my maximal tastes. I mean, if one is trying to integrate as many symbols as possible including understandings of space that have taken place within painting history such as perspectival devices, atmosphere and the feeling of the picture being a window onto a world or a stage, then I'm not sure what other style would be left? The sci-fi diorama seems the natural outcome to me! haha...

I think some people cringe when they hear the word sci-fi, I think this may be perhaps because we are worried that we are about to experience something that may only tick the boxes of the trope, rather than pushing the envelope and introducing some original thought. I think each classification comes with its own opportunities and pitfalls, there are plenty of emotional and conceptual resonances and meandering that sci-fi landscapes may conjure up. Some of my paintings go further than others into this genre's tropes, they become almost immediately recognisable, like a 70's sci-fi novel cover. I hope these paintings will approach the viewer playfully, luring in with their public accessibility, and introducing them to this world, which can then branch outwards, linking in further concepts.

*(can include in this section something about The Foundation Stones book)*

## Eroticism / Orgasmysticism

There is a thread of eroticism that runs through visionary artists from Blake, to Dali, to Ernst Fuchs. Drawing on Freud and Jung there is a sexual force that motivates everything. And this sexual force exists in the collective unconscious. That is the anima, which is also the source of creative ability for man, or the animus for a woman. Confronting the shadow is only a minor work in comparison to confronting your anima/animus; your sexual counterpart.

Erotic energy is the first mover of the kabbalah. "Identifying Keter, the uppermost sefirah with delight and desire…. Keter can be regarded as a primary source of psychic energy or volition, the Kabbalists understood it as initiating a series of sexual relations among the sefirot" "Keter is referred to as the will of all wills". So in this view erotic energy is the most basic force. The erotic goes hand in hand with the visionary as artists tap into the ground of being. Eros is the first god in Parmenides' ancient Greek cosmology that impels evolution. Eroticism is the fabric at the centre of being. We can see a flowing sea of being that has an erotic nature in that it is always reaching towards something. Look at the phallic Yonic forms that are created when one substance flows into another. Look at a field of grass stretching up towards the sun. it is at the heart of life that surrounds us that emerges out of chaos. The Mandelbrot set is erotic. Or a particle collider trace map.

[Images of Mandelbrot set and particle collider traces would go here]

This erotic force is everywhere in some ways it is also the life force. Tarkovsky's Mirror and Bruegel's The Suicide of Saul, both flow with the same energy. This energy is an erotic force that flows through O'Keeffe and Bernini.

[Images would go here]

And in many artists this erotic life force energy forms rivers of bodies. In Rubens, Joffra, Bouguereau, and many others the bodies float and are unrestrained by gravity. The bodies become like particles or a flock of birds. There has to be enough of a buildup that a crescendo of chaos is reached. Much like how a single human house may not be particularly organic looking but when we see enough houses spread over a town looking down from a mountain or from a satellite, we begin to see its fractal and organic nature.

As humans we are highly attuned to the human body, closely followed by the face and then the eyes. Every small gesture generates an emotional response in us. In addition to this the body is a sexual force, seeing it en masse gives it a grouping akin to an orgy, or to a colony of ants. There is an element of abandoning reason for Dionysian oblivion and of joining with the chaotic forces that surround our body.

When we have sex do we engulf or are we engulfed?

[Images would go here]

Eroticism is the greatest force of materialisation, of embodiment.

It contains the guts and the skin. It is the garment of blood that must be worn to embrace experience in its profuse expanse. (see Jesus and The Clouds of Ololon in Immortality)

> So saying, the Virgin divided Six-fold & with a shriek
> Dolorous that ran thro all Creation a Double Six-fold Wonder!
> Away from Ololon she divided & fled into the depths
> Of Milton's Shadow as a Dove upon the stormy Sea.
> Then as a Moony Ark Ololon descended to Felphams Vale
> In clouds of blood, in streams of gore, with dreadful thunderings
> Into the Fires of Intellect that rejoiced in Felphams Vale

look out for the Moony ark and streams of erotic gore in the images below.

[Images of artworks by Ewoud van Rijn, Richard Dadd, Johfra would go here]

These figures can easily become abstracted, As in Johfra and Van Rijn. The figures become a single substance like clay. We see the same thing in Dali, Escher and others when they atomise figures and clothing. We are clearly talking about a realm of forms. So although seemingly violent dismemberment is taking place there is a sense that the body exists beyond the physical. It is a forming force that is being visualised. The morphogenetic field of Sheldrake, or the astral plane of Blavatsky and Steiner.

[Images of artworks by Dali, philippe caza, Escher, Moebius, mati klarwein, Tchelitchew, Harry Zed Hughes would go here]

> "the whole creation will be consumed and appear infinite and holy…
> This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment."
> If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.
> For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern.

I see a hallucinogenic eroticism contained within all life, and I hope that my art will reflect and highlight this. Overt figurative sexuality is an extension of this. I think we need a healthy injection of bacchanalian dream states into our materialist bean counting society. Depictions of sexuality in a fine art context are highly controversial. And it is no exception for me, Firstly because male depictions of women are seen as objectifying. And secondly because there is a division between the new age spiritual movement and the social justice movement, which often sacrifices character traits for equality. As a man I do not wish to perpetuate anything which may demean women, but I also wish to value and depict the powerful sexual force that I see within people and especially women.

### A note on objectification

It would be prudent at this point to respond to the complaint of the objectification of women. Let's unpack this statement as it is a term often used but do we really understand what it means?

Art objectifies and subjectifies everything. Artifice is the materialisation or embodiment of something, it is necessarily objectifying by definition. At the same time art is created from subjective experience. The problem objectifying women in art happens on another level. The argument is leveled that women are depicted with less agency than men. They are pigeon holed as passive. Without going too far into this there are elements of the feminine and masculine psyche that do contain their own traits and these cannot be wholly dismissed. For instance it is commonly expressed from sex therapists that men and women both benefit from focusing energy on the woman. There is a primal preference for the masculine to be focusing on the feminine, which is desirable for both sexes. Of course these are generalities but they are still useful.

First off I would like to state that, all art is valuable whether made from a male or a female, art history has often overlooked women and this should be revised. Everything should be judged on aesthetic merit.

Ideology creates a shadow that it designates as degenerate. The Nazi's pushed out abstraction and expressionism. And the CIA backed west pushed out realism.

Consumerism and the cult of the individual structured by Edward Bernays, push away satisfaction and gratitude. And focus us on receiving material rather than creating.

We still feel the reverberations and jargon, from these ideologies. Figuration is seen as non-progressive, Abstraction as degenerate, and symbolism and expressionism as relic's.

It is of utmost importance that male artists are able to depict women. They explore how their own sexual urges may be unified into the broader architecture of art. Furthermore we must find healthy evolutions of the erotic/artistic depiction of women. It is important that we do not reduce them to lacking agency. But we also need to develop a language of their unique and shared powers. If this is to be done in a unified way that is beautiful and erotic we are going to need the full arsenal of contemporary art. Otherwise we pair back this task to advertising, popular cinema and pornography, in other words to materialist consumerism. Rather than the scope of academic thought and the fine arts, which are broader in ontological scope.

When someone paints a woman, especially if it's a male artist, then we call it male fantasy, just a degenerate vision of utopia. Our modern dominant ideology has become tied up with tearing down many of the hierarchies and structures of the past. Gender is one of these structures, which there is a long intellectual and spiritual tradition of exploration into, that now has become taboo.

All art falls into a particular ideology. East German and West German art. The abstract expressionists deny all figuration. Certain art forms are narrowed out as not conforming to current ideologies. The current ideology has problems with men depicting women, with nude bodies and figuration in general, and even with the idea of beauty or of anything that could be construed as sentimental. There have been similar wholesale exclusions of "degenerate" art during the time of Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia or Western Modernism.

Men have always looked at women. Do we think we will stop women being objectified by stopping all male artists from painting women? What on earth do we think we will accomplish? It's just a matter of taste, which has clearly emerged. We are afraid of truth. Afraid of structure and hierarchy and of delineation of differentiation. These elements are instead pushed into the shadows. They become unconscious and in fact dangerous. If men aren't going to depict women, how are we going to evolve that capacity within ourselves? How can we develop an erotic love that encompasses mind and body, and lets the creative juices flow? Instead we push the erotic away and say you are not worthy of art and so the erotic is pushed away to the porn industry. And to advertising and to tv/movies. How are we meant to develop our imaginations hampered in this way? Furthermore we are scared of the beautiful. Classifying it again as degenerate, or amateur. I want to re-embrace the amateur. I think once we re-awaken these forces of body erotic and beauty romanticism there will actually be plenty of progress to be made.

This is important.

For example William Blake sees the many facets of the feminine as aspects of the city of our imagination. The feminine imagination meets with the masculine consciousness. in a sexual alchemy that allows us to know ourselves, allows us to reveal infinite being.

> "Jerusalem, "a city, yet a woman", is builded in the heart of every man by acts of love and kindness, and this is the work of the imagination."

why female emanations are essential:

> "When in Eternity Man converses with Man they enter
> Into each others Bosom (which are Universes of delight)
> In mutual interchange. and first their Emanations meet
> Surrounded by their Children. if they embrace & comingle
> The Human Four-fold Forms mingle also in thunders of Intellect
> But if the Emanations mingle not; with storms & agitations
> Of earthquakes & consuming fires they roll apart in fear
> For Man cannot unite with Man but by their Emanations
> Which stand both Male & Female at the Gates of each Humanity"

Blake can be seen to have a strong relationship with his anima, his Jerusalem. And the emanations of the fourfold human which are female forms

Some of my paintings will be of a specific woman and will hopefully contain many individual traits, others will be depicting spirits of a particular force, much like Greek gods and goddess' are often singular points of character, an individual human may exhibit varying tendencies of many gods as aspects of their personality. Art in my eyes has a tendency and perhaps an obligation towards generalities. For an artwork to hold up to multiple viewers it needs to contain universalities. I hope that no one views any painting as a statement that the depiction is always true for every individual. I certainly wouldn't want someone to view one of my paintings of a woman and to think that this is how I see all women, or how I would like all women to be. It is rather a depiction of an experiential force; this is my experience of erotic energy, It is my hope that when others view this they will feel the connection between eroticism, power and energy, Eros as a fundamental force in the creation of life, and feminine energy, Yin and mother earth as the birthing power base that is the bedrock of all energetic growth.

I am a mere man. Shall I be forbidden to worship at the altar of women? Must we only depict ourselves? Every artwork ends up being a self portrait in the end, but must we also begin as a self portrait? Or can we at least begin by trying to depict our experience of the other?

### The Erotic Landscape

The eroticism we are defining is not only in the figure. We see the same forces embodied in the landscape. Let us take the landscape paintings of Courbet for example, who tapped into the erotic bodily force and the river of life.

> All those numerous paintings by Courbet come to mind, which show a slit or a ledge, a dark, usually moist grotto. … Of course, Courbet's earth is female, the big mother, "la terre" as the giving maw (Metken, 1997, p.55)

[Image: Courbet, "The Source of the Loue", oil on Canvas]

> "He discovered virgin lands where no one had yet placed a foot, aspects and forms of landscape that one could say were unknown before he painted them.... Each time he plunged into the bosom of deep nature, he was like a man who has penetrated a beehive and come out covered with honey; he returned charged with perfume and poetry. He descended into the deep irregular hollows where the spring is born of the trickle from rocks, he watched the drops of water collect, let slide between his fingers the silver of small waterfalls. ... No one painted in strokes so frank, just that quivering humidity. One cannot contemplate Stream of the Puits Noir, Source of the Loue, Shaded Stream, all these fresh and bright landscapes ... without receiving them like a gust of pure air right in the face"

I would however contend with "virgin" lands, and flip it, so that a person that hasn't been into nature is the virgin. As nature is in perpetual copulation all by itself. We are the virgins when we remain couped up in our modern world plugged in to technology without feeling the wind on our face and the smell of ripe and rotting plants.

### Romanticism

Romanticism is all about reclaiming the body of emotion. Arising first out of the industrial revolution as we were undergoing a materialist spiritual split. Romanticism is needed once again to seduce the viewer into an experience of chaos that is outside their consumer ideology.

Nigel Cooke and Peter Doig are good examples of this type of radical painting - one which contains a romantic spirit, and uses aesthetic effects to make non-linear arguments. After discussing examples from these artists, we will return to the death of painting and how photography, conceptualism and cinema feeds into the resurrection of painting as romantic.

"Medium" once designated the physical material that you worked with, and within the parameters of, to create. For quite some time now it has moved beyond the physical medium to the embodied medium; or to the apparatus of that medium. Painting in this expanded field, using non-traditional materials, is an embodiment of painting without using the physical medium. A comprehensive definition of "medium" will take on both the physical and embodied. It is in using physical paint that the full force of medium comes into play, and perhaps it is for this reason that painting, more so than sculpture or photography, has held onto the physical nature of its medium. Perhaps this is mostly due to its long history.

Nigel Cooke is an artist that provides a good example of a kind of painting that is New Romanticism. He provides an example of engagement with a history of the medium, in a contemporary context, along with his use of multiple levels of syntax within a pictorial whole. To paint now, in a period full of postmodern ironies, one must be fully aware of all the rejections of modernism that have taken place. When Nigel Cooke paints it is from a Metamodern standpoint, that is he tries to create something beautiful, that at the same time contains a healthy scepticism and irony. He at once acknowledges the death of painting and creates something new in the dark space that follows, in the disintegration of the pictorial space.

Nigel Cooke's self criticality is embodied by his characters that take on the artist's seemingly pointless search for meaning, they are depicted in desolate post-apocalyptic landscapes with often storm-like masses of abstract brush strokes filling the sky. Nigel Cooke describes these characters as "a generic creative figure, I wanted to embody creative thought in a certain form. Part Van Gogh and part philosopher tramp vagrant from ancient historical painting, a St Sebastian or St Jerome figure." I think if we look at St. Jerome In The Wilderness by Andrea Mantegna we can easily see St Jerome fitting into a scene of Cooke's such as To work is to play. In Mantegna's Jerome Painting, we can see a similar composition to some of Cooke's Paintings: the large rock behind Jerome takes up most of the painting and dwarves the figure, and to the sides of the rock we find keyhole like vistas onto far away landscapes. Mimosa in Valbonne is a good example of a similarly composed painting. Both Mantegna and Cooke are trying to unite multiple genres, for Mantegna the landscape and the figure painting, for Cooke abstract painting and cartoon and figures in a landscape.

If we take the traditional Jerome in the wilderness as painted throughout history, the depictions of wilderness seem to become more foreign than other paintings which may be set indoors, perhaps this is due to the highly constructed nature of an outdoor scene, which must logistically be painted inside. If we take Titian's St. Jerome In The Wilderness this construction is highly evident, and yet it does not take away from the painting but adds to it. We feel the man, the rock, the tree and the background as separate elements resting in the dim stage set of the painting surface, here we truly feel the desolation, and the abstinence of the monk that has removed himself from the world of man. In Cooke's To work is to play, we find an equally desolate constructed landscape, architectural forms reminiscent of Russian constructivist architecture and concrete jungle type contemporary public architecture. Squares and rectangles seem to drift out of this architecture and to rest ambiguously between the scene and the canvas/picture plane, perhaps these have drifted out of a Mondrian or another abstract hard edge painting. Cooke's Painting contrasts Mondrian in his irony, Cooke's constructed world full of art and artist like figures is always falling apart, it is doomed to fail from the start, Cooke knows this and yet he continues to paint anyway. Mondrian on the other hand continued his modernist paintings for many years seemingly without much change once he found his signature style. Where was Mondrian's self criticality? He believed he found the truth without question, and was brazen enough to give up on many tropes of figurative representation, thus abandoning common man, in his eyes rising up to a new plane. But where is the beauty here? And most importantly where is the human? Mondrian's Heroism is reflected in the failed socialist architecture depicted in To work is to play, the utilitarian utopian vision has descended into a ghetto for the hopeless, perhaps this is the fate that awaits the hubris of the heroic artist.

Cooke's New Accursed Art Club, is another example of themes we have talked about around the artist figure lost in their own landscape. However the title suggests that these figures are being art critics, some perhaps painters, but others reading contemplating or just drinking, they are perhaps merrymakers and patrons enjoying themselves and their prestige while from an exterior view they have fallen from grace. I am immediately reminded of Peter Doig's Metropolitain (House of Pictures), which is at once a replication of Daumier's Collector, and a carnival character: the European flaneur, a self portrait of Doig as an onlooker that fetishises the Trinidad world around him in a series of vistas. The purveyor of fine scenes, the voyeur. In Doig's painting the Collector has a red nose from the Trinidad sun and white cheeks. He is in fact a clown. We see here a repeat of the self criticality of the artist/critique found in Cooke's images. They both draw on this tradition from Daumier and his many paintings of collectors and artists, Daumier at once critiques the strange clicky atmosphere of the art world, whilst living in it. Cooke's paintings go further than Daumier though as Cooke is trying to turn "painting into a place or a being. Making a place tangible and realised" he hopes to embody tasks and emotions in his paintings in order to make them stand on their own in a world post-paintings death.

Another Painting By Doig Grande Riviere is the first painting Doig made of Trinidad, he began it from a series of photographs he had taken there of an old white horse surrounded by corbou (small black vultures). This scene depicted in this painting could easily have become a pretty cliché landscape painting, but Doig's treatment produces a sinister undertone: to begin with there are no people, which introduces an eerie silence, that is compounded by the darkness of the sky shadows and water, and the humid saturation of colour in the dense foliage that fills the horizon. The starry sky drifts down into the water, however it is reflected so clearly that it becomes an actual sky itself, upon which the landscape hovers, the brightness of the sand and the horse at night adds to this mystical feeling. They appear to glow as if producing their own light, it's not hard to imagine the horse as Doig himself surrounded his demons. We are reminded here of Heart Of Darkness, a colonial guilt and fear, Doig asks himself why did I come here? It isn't my place. To find out he continues to paint there in his studio, Perhaps as a Marlow looking for his Kurtz.

[Image: Grande Riviere 2001-02, 228.8 x 358.4 cm Peter Doig]

This next painting by Peter Doig carries on in the mystical theme, Doig's paintings are romantic in that they convey a sense of yearning that the viewer can lose themselves in. It is important to note that his mystic romanticism is always balanced by melancholy and a sinister darkness. Once again the stars appear to permeate the surface and cut through solid objects, clouds, water and the road. This places the cloudscape in the realm of a Hubble photographed nebula. And there is a sense that the figures are misplaced in their costumes, imposters, perhaps alien. That look straight at the viewer, as gatekeepers to an alien world over the rainbow bridge

[Image: Gasthof zur Muldentalsperre, 2000/02, 196 x 296 cm, Peter Doig]

The potential of the painting medium lies in its set of coordinates, its terrain in art history. It takes attributes and areas of reference from its long history as well as modern and postmodern challenges that have changed it forever. At multiple points the challenges to painting have been so fundamental, that painting was claimed to be dead. However with the clarity of vision that comes from observing the actual effect on painting, we can see that these catalyst moments have only deepened it. in the words of Nietzsche "what does not kill me makes me stronger".

Photography killed painting; it killed the photographic part, painting as a documentary tool. This allowed painting to be reborn, as an expression of things other than documentation: leading to expressionism, symbolism, futurism and other Avant-garde movements. Similarly Duchamp with the readymade, and conceptual art that followed, killing painting again by privileging the idea over the image. Painting from a conceptual art standpoint, was seen as too traditional and beautiful. Beauty and feeling were disregarded and often rejected, and the idea was held as the groundwork from which physical material was constructed. Anti-aesthetic here rests as the default position. Conceptual art stands within postmodernism, it is one of many reactions to the naive heroism of modernism, along with installation and performance art.

After modernism and its rebounding critical postmodernism, painting has been repeatedly dismissed in art criticism. Painting is no longer a default position to hold for any educated contemporary artist. To paint now is a conceptual choice, it is anti-heroic, and it is a resurrection of spontaneity. As a conceptual choice it contains an enormous syntax of philosophical spiritual and social ideas. Along with its materiality that allows room for anti-narrative. Painting can be more radical than most conceptual art, as its nature is indeterminate, a picture cannot be expressed in words, and is thus a confounding non-lingual eminence, that sears into the eyes of our science-obsessed age. Unlike in photography and cinema the brush mark itself becomes a construction, we are confronted with an ever dissolving set of forms that move between gesture, cartoon, dream, light based representation, line based arabesque, colourful daubs, stains, and particle clouds. Here there is no ground and there is nothing to grasp, we just fall forever past possibilities of worlds we won't know. This is a body without organs, and a thousand plateaus.

> "Painting can no longer just be painting. Today it is also necessarily a form of conceptual art, and as such it must be judged in relation to conceptual practices in other media, and in turn it must hold its own in this comparison." — VERWOERT

Though Paintings recent dark ages following its deaths, the hopeful romantic spirit has fled to other mediums such as photography and most notably cinema. Cinema is the most effective medium, it has the most access to the emotions through an enveloping experience, it is also time based and therefore can contain music in sync with images. As a medium closely related to photography it managed to avoid the death of figuration that painting went through. It remained as a storytelling medium that was never to forgo beauty. Through film makers such as Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, Hitchcock, Kubrick and even David Lynch whose anti-narrative and multi planar films, that sit happily within a postmodern framework, still remain beautiful and moving on an emotional level. Cinema in this sense managed to retain a certain amount of romanticism. And as Painting once again regains its romantic spirit, in a nonetheless more self-conscious form, it draws from cinema as its most immediate predecessor. This is necessary because cinema doesn't have the absolute freedom of painting, the propensity for self-reflexive, process based creation. The artist begins to understand as they make, more than other mediums. As everything that the artwork will be is already there to witness, unlike the movie editing process, which always sits between shooting and viewing. Painting is a medium to live with, while it is being made and when it is in our home/space. It is an adjunct to our lives that can slide between object in the room or subjective experience when the image has our complete attention.

Values traditionally argued to be against painting are actually best held by painting. Conceptual art via syntax. Performance via process. Critique of time and space, and knowing, via mark making and Worlding, it draws attention to the construction of a reality that we are never fully omniscient of, more so even than cinema. The medium has multiple systems of truth built into it. The tangled mess that is painting, its contrasting histories, techniques and styles, builds to a horizon of complex possibilities. Its strength is non-verbal, visual nature, which embraces complexity. A painting's beauty; the aesthetic experience, traditional or otherwise, can generate a criticality in itself: when a viewer perceives something as beautiful, they are already convinced conceptually by the content of the painting, not the physical content, but the emotional felt experience. The viewer understands through the experience, not a literal concept or lingual reasoning, but rather a rhizomatic displacement of their reality into the reality of the painting.

## COMMUNITY

The magic rabbit community

This is an extension of the real world outcomes section, beyond painting, and into the intentional community I am creating. It's important that this is included, as Integration stretches outwards beyond the artwork, until everything is the artwork. Moving towards the ultimate life affirming YES. the magic rabbit. the Child. Passing through to the next wave. Falling through to the next step. Choose love over fear to make the next step rather than becoming rigid. Love is the state of the child. The state of creative freedom. No hesitation.

### Freedom is a choice

We can be grateful that we are born in an age when the default stance is to do what you are told and to not step outside of the centralised treadmill that has been laid out for us. Freedom of thought and action is not a default right that is given to us. Instead it must be taken. We must consciously reach out and flip the switch. And decide we want to be free.

For better or worse we are moving towards a slave and master world. The super rich have gradually centralised all the power for the slave's own safety. So anyone not awake enough to step into the new world will simply stay in the old one. Perhaps the controlling mega powers of the world are doing us a dark favour.

### Location

The community will be located (abundant life force, dynamic landscape, other tribes)

Tell me more?

### Political

Living freedom vs. dead freedom (pathological)

Chaos and order. Pathological freedom. However order is a characteristic of the current narrative. Could we just say that there is a natural swing backwards and forwards?

Hard times > strong men (stressors strengthen mitochondria, stagnant cells die. fasting detox)
Strong men > good times (chaos is integrated into new order)
Good times > weak men (order becomes stagnant if it stops moving and integrating chaos. people become complacent last men. they are fearful and contracting, they are scared of something new.)
weak men > hard times (stagnancy becomes disease) (order and chaos are divided.)

The body is order-holding chaos. New chaotic elements are continuously integrated into the body. If a new chaos is rejected out of fear the body will become stagnant. Eventually the chaos will find a way to enter and the stagnant cells will die. a new paradigm will be established.

Freedom is order-integrating chaos. Without chaos there is no movement, so no freedom.
Without order there is no body, so no freedom.

If you believe a body is pathological you must make a new body. Destroying or trying to hold on to the old body will not work.

### Environmental

The community is designed to integrate harmoniously with the surrounding rainforest environment. Principles of permaculture are followed to create a sustainable system that works with nature. Food forests provide fruit and nut trees integrated with vegetable gardens, without the need for clearing land or artificial fertilizers. Water catchment systems collect rainfall and channel it to where it is needed. Renewable energy like solar panels and micro hydro power generation is utilized. Buildings are constructed from natural and recycled materials and designed to have low environmental impact. Waste streams are minimized through composting systems. Overall, the community aims to enrich the rainforest ecosystem rather than deplete it.

### Financial

The community embraces free market economics and the right to accumulate personal wealth and property. Members are encouraged to be entrepreneurial and generate abundance through business ventures. Those who succeed financially are respected for their ingenuity. However, the most financially successful members are expected to generously give back by funding community growth and supporting members in need. The goal is cooperative capitalism that lifts up the community as a whole. Strategic reinvestment of profits aims to maximize efficiency, innovation and self-sufficiency. Sound money based on intrinsic value is preferred over fiat currency. Savings are encouraged to provide security and capital for investment. Overall, a prosperity mindset prevails - wealth creation through free exchange is viewed as beneficial for all.

### Legal

The community adheres to principles of natural law and non-aggression. Disputes are resolved internally whenever possible. Members voluntarily agree to binding arbitration and restitution systems managed within the community. Defensive force is sanctioned if needed to secure person and property from clear aggression. Victimless actions are not deemed criminal offenses. The community seeks self-governance and separation from centralized state authority to the extent feasible. Governing decisions are made at the most local level possible. Legal priorities are securing the community's autonomy and promoting members' wellbeing. External laws are only respected when they do not clearly violate individual sovereignty or community values.

### Social

The community maintains a sense of exclusivity from the outside world. Social bonds within the group are emphatically promoted and valued above external ties. Longstanding members exemplify community virtues and provide guidance to new members during their integration phase. Acceptance of community beliefs is cultivated through immersive lifestyle conditioning. Individual expression is encouraged to strengthen the community's diverse skill sets. Members aim to improve humanity through pioneering enlightened modes of living. Contact with outsiders is generally limited to commerce and recruitment of new members. Periodic community rituals and traditions reinforce solidarity and commitment to shared ideals. An atmosphere prevails that being part of the community makes one elevated above the ignorance and dysfunction of mainstream society.

The community utilizes architectural principles focused on efficiency, modularity, and natural beauty. Homes are constructed from earthships, cob, and other techniques using on-site and natural materials. Geodesic dome structures inspired by visionary Buckminster Fuller allow large communal spaces enclosed by graceful geometric forms. Passive solar orientation, rainwater harvesting, and renewable energy systems are incorporated to maximize sustainability. Buildings are harmoniously integrated into the surrounding forest through organic shapes and earth-toned colors. Yet modern conveniences like running water, electricity, and the internet are readily available. Structures are adaptable and expandable using modular components, giving the community flexibility to grow. Transportation infrastructure emphasizes walkability, cycling, and electric vehicles. Overall, architecture aims to merge ecological design with technological innovation and aesthetic elegance.

### Cultural

The community prioritizes shared spaces that strengthen social bonds and cultivate culture. A central temple provides gathering space for rituals, ceremonies, and contemplation. The dining hall hosts nightly communal meals. The recreation center offers opportunities for physical activity, creativity, and leisure. The bathhouse provides rejuvenating hydrotherapy experiences. Libraries grant access to information resources and media. Performance spaces enable artistic expression through music, theater, and dance. Shops offer goods and services while bringing people together. Plazas, gardens, and natural areas provide additional communal space. These shared amenities are designed to enrich relationships, foster togetherness, and elevate the community's collective lived experience.

(ai generated) Spiritual life emphasizes direct mystical communion with the natural world. Time spent alone meditating in the forest is encouraged. Psychedelic sacraments provide glimpses of alternate realities and oneness with the universe. Yogic practices harmonize body, mind and spirit. Sacred geometry, astrology, and numerology reveal hidden cosmic wisdom. Pagan-inspired rituals. High holy days mark the passing seasons with ceremonies and celebration. Members embody earth-based spirituality; living interdependently with the complex web of life. Spiritual insights are validated through shared experiential gnosis rather than dogmatic belief. The spiritual path is one of ever-unfolding enlightenment and mystery.

### Sexual

(Freedom without harm.)

Tell me more?

Do as thou wilt -
Fulfilment of all desire

The community holds a libertine view toward sexuality, believing consenting adults should have freedom to responsibly explore their desires. Committed relationships are neither forbidden nor mandatory. Ethical non-monogamy and polyamory are accepted. Members are encouraged to communicate their needs and manage jealousy proactively. Sexual energy is valued as sacred life-force that can be harnessed for individual and collective empowerment.

## JOURNEY

### Increasing the bandwidth of life

(this section doesn't mention the castle ontology or the magician but it has some examples of active imagination. This swing can be used in many realms. It builds our imaginal castle. The swing is also how our magician builds the life force of our castle. and its powers of reasoning and concentration. so the swing optimises and increases bandwidth at all levels of being so that there can be a powerful flow from the physical all the way to the higher self (magician) through all layers of being.)

We exist in a space between two extremes. The height and the depth. We can imagine ourselves travelling horizontally through time, we are existing in a band that can vary in width. Many people live a bland life, their band is narrow. There is a gravitational pull that always brings some of the band towards the middle line, so if you have a narrow band it will never reach far into the heights or depths. Whereas if you have a wide band you can reach up further into the heights or depths whilst fulfilling the needs of the gravity of the middle line.

One bandwidth axis we exist in is between Apollo and Dionysus, Apollo is seen as the god of reason, and Dionysus as the god of the irrational. We can also see this as the conscious and the subconscious.

In the case of the imagination it can be a delicate balance between these two natures. If we try to direct our vision we may become trapped in our conscious quest and remain only apollonian. To escape your Apollo nature you must invert your desired outcome momentarily and then ride the rebound once you have dipped yourself in the soup of the crucible. And conversely to go deeper into the Dionysian subconscious soup it helps to record your image stream in some way. Otherwise the thought stream may pass you by and be forgotten as new thoughts replace them. Once recorded, or pulled further up into the consciousness of the perceivable world, the creations are then added to the collections of avatars heading back down into the crucible. The more that is created the more Avatars are created that may re-enter the soup. Two images come to mind here. One is that of the river of time that needs to be dammed in order that we may retain some of the flow in the present. The other is of a big ball that is rolling in a bowl of hot wax. If we are able to cool the ball enough from above it will retain a layer of wax every time it rolls around. This way we can make the ball larger. We are building feedback loops between realms of consciousness that build creation.

### Mental Inversion swings

If you are trying to envision a forest valley front on you may find it hard. You must come at it with your peripheral vision. To do so don't push forwards all the time but invert your desire. Invert the forest valley so that everything air is now solid and everything solid is now air, you now have yourself an upside-down inside-out world. Now invert your vision back again and you will find you have made progress, the trees will have more leaves and there will be more diverse plants and colours, in short the level of detail and 'reality' will be increased.

To make yourself into a giant lizard god you must shrink yourself on each out breath and grow yourself on each in-breath. Body the size of a > dog> bear > mouse > elephant > ant > dinosaur > flea > whale > microbe > city > cell > country > molecule > ocean > atom > world > subatomic > solar system > string > galaxy.... a giant lizard god the size of a galaxy eating everything, other galaxies, becoming bigger and bigger until you encompass everything.

### Multiplicity Soup

In order to put yourself in the best place to grow a new limb, a new building, a new forest or any structure. You may find it useful to dive into a multiplicity soup first. If you want a specific limb, first embody many other limbs in your mind, shapeshift your body in every way you can imagine and stretch yourself until you are more fluid. If you want wings, first embody a fish with scales and fins, an elephant's trunk, a triceratop's horns, the tail of a monkey. Feel your arms becoming spines of other animals. Feel multiple arms, multiple legs. And then explode your wings outward and look and you will see they are far more formed than at first, they are structured and detailed, fine and strong and responsive.

### Physical Inversion Swings

Or, How you can prepare your physical and emotional body so that conceptually and spiritually you can go further and deeper and keep grounded.

Or, Inversion swings for maximum life bandwidth.

Rembrandt is the master of light by virtue of his overwhelming darkness.

We covered the mental swings of the imagination in the interview on page … however this concept permeates the mental, physical and spiritual. Inversion swings are performed constantly in all aspects of life. If we try to move constantly towards one end of the spectrum we lose our swinging momentum and we find ourselves being dragged back down by gravity towards a resting state. This applies to waking and sleeping, eating and fasting, anabolic and catabolic states of the body, and using the conscious and unconscious mind for directional visualisation. If we try to stay awake indefinitely we will become tired, If we rest all day we may have trouble sleeping. If we constantly are active we don't give our body time to repair. These are all examples of us trying to swing in only one direction. If we don't make the time to swing the other way for a while nature will find a way to bring us back to the central line somehow. Let's talk about how we can ride the waves and make use of the swings in our favour, growing a better body and clearing out old cells.

The natural state of the body is one of harmony and health and it also is a state that primes the body for imaginative insight. All of the processes that activate the Pineal gland and the third eye are also simultaneously going to support your hormonal optimisation. Shamanism is our birthright as humans.

#### Acute Stressors

Placing acute stressors on the body such as compound movements of resistance training and Cold and heat therapy can help to give the body the signal that it is alive and that it will need to continue to grow to adapt. Acute stressors as part of a natural swinging diurnal rhythm, will signal your natural hormones to increase. They will be released as we sleep and will reach their peak when we wake up. This can produce a drive to accomplish our goals through the day.

Momentarily swinging the body into states that push it beyond its boundaries, will keep the body and mind adapting and becoming stronger. Acute stress (a swing) is good and chronic stress (not swinging but stuck at one end of the spectrum) is bad. The ultimate physical swing is super intense activity and super deep rest: Acute stress is achieved by high-intensity training or sprinting for short periods rather than long runs/jogging. It is achieved effectively by lifting heavy weights and making sure you sleep well.

Dream(goal) > will power < consciousness
/
Inversion swings optimise and grow
/
Vessel = body mind spirit

Life is inversion swings, whether we are creating, imagining or reading. In reverie, or deep in the physical body.

Our being is made up of a physical, an emotional and a spiritual/intellectual/conceptual aspect. They often are linked together, so acute stressors are often exercises in will power that transfers to all three domains. And we move ourselves into different emotions and states of mind via our body.

#### SLEEP/WAKE

Deep sleep and high wake are best emphasised through exercise, light and food manipulation.

To sleep deeply we need some physical exercise in the day, we also need to get some sun or at least very intense light preferably in the morning to set our bio clock. It is best if you can sun gaze to get the most energy from the sun, and this can be done safely at sunrise and sunset. Only do what is comfortable, and enjoy the serotonin your body produces for you to celebrate the day.

Use calcium to contract your muscles and magnesium to relax them. Adequate calcium can be taken in through diet but to absorb it we need to get enough sun to produce Vitamin D. Magnesium can be bought in bulk as Epsom salt, then mixed one to one and applied to the body before bed. This is cheap and the body will absorb what it needs.

#### Fasting and Feeding

Your body produces cortisol naturally as we wake up, this is a good thing as it gives us energy for the day. As with all these things they are bad chronically but are essential in their appropriate acute placements. If you fast, or only eat fats and protein, refraining from carbohydrates during the morning you will find yourself in a more steady state of mental clarity. Eating carbohydrates at this time are more likely to be stored as fat anyway. (Sometimes gaining some fat can also be a good thing but mostly we do well to avoid it.) Instead consume proteins and fats and a coffee if you wish. Then eating your carbohydrates at the end of the day after a workout will refill glycogen stores in your muscles and give you an insulin spike which will help you build muscle. You should sleep well.

You want to have a fairly low GI through the day and then a spike around dinner, and you want high GI carbs so that the spike goes down while you are sleeping, as we produce growth hormone mostly at night when our GI levels go back down.

Going through periods of fasting can allow the body to detoxify and remove old cells, this includes dry fasting, water fasting, intermittent fasting, and zero carb diets. There is a sliding scale. You want periods of feast and famine to increase your body's receptivity to nutrients and continue to grow.

A day of fasting will increase your body's ability to use food to build muscle. Fasting will also put you in an alkaline state as will hyperventilating, which increases visions and interconnected thoughts.

#### Breathing swings

It can also be beneficial to swing your body to hyper oxygenated and high carbon dioxide levels, through hyperventilation and breath holds. The swing between carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs naturally during the night when we begin to breathe more deeply before our dreams. If we perform oxygenation swings during the day we find ourselves moving into a visionary state.

Just like heat, cold and exercise, temporary hyperventilation and hypoxia are acute stressors that generate strong adaptive reactions from the body. Increasing your heart rate variability and helps our circadian rhythm to optimise. Swinging in short periods of time between hyperventilation and Hypoxia, has a range of benefits including increasing the body's ability to produce and use energy. The Wim Hof breathing method sets a good amount of time between swings for optimising the health of your body and mind. Taking roughly 30 deep fast breaths and then holding your breath on the out breath, followed by and in breath hold. Then repeat the whole process 2 or more times for an increase in the swings. There is also an experiential journey you will take yourself on doing the breathing. The hyperventilation can feel like hard work, holding the outbreath can be a relief after this and further on in the hold there is an absent-minded-ness. Then the in-breath and hold can feel euphoric and visually stimulating, even hallucinogenic. Wim Hof suggests starting the day with the routine. I like to do it before bed as I go into a visual dream state and sleep deeply. You can also integrate this breathing into a workout, if you can find a way to do it safely as it will increase your VO2 max; the maximum oxygen you can use to fuel your energy output.

#### Sun Gazing - light swings

It is important to limit bright lights at night especially blue coloured light in order to signal melatonin to begin which in turn signals hormone production. These systems are all closely tied together. It is important then to get as much sun in winter as we can, and get plenty in summer too without burning ourselves. ideally we will sungaze at sunrise and sunset standing vertically with our feet in the soil. Then when the sun is at its Zenith we sunbathe horizontally, nude and for 10 minutes in summer and probably as much as you can get in winter, whenever the clouds clear.

Letting the sun enter our eyes helps our pineal and pituitary glands to regulate our hormones. The bright red and infrared light of sunrise and sunset feel great for the eyes, afterwards I feel a deep feeling of relaxation. The stimulation of the pineal gland helps to strengthen the biorhythm cutting down on the drowsy making melatonin in the day for a greater release at night and increasing serotonin. Infrared light is very healing for the body

If you get enough sun in the day your pineal gland will produce melatonin at night. This will help you sleep and dream deeply. Melatonin is only one molecule away from DMT, which is perhaps also produced by the pineal gland. The chemical structure is only differentiated by DMT having one more oxygen molecule, which may explain why we begin to breathe more deeply and quickly at the start of a rapid eye movement dream sleep cycle.

#### Sun Bathing

UVB rays get the body to produce vitamin D. UVA rays are associated with melanoma and DNA damage. We want to balance our UVA with UVB as much as possible. UVB rays are strongest at midday whereas UVA rays are highest in midmorning and afternoon.

Also most sun creams only block UVB rays, you wont get vitamin D as easily and you will also not realise that you are getting too much non-tanning rays such as UVA.

You want to be fully nude so that you produce the most vitamin D for the amount of time you spend in the sun.

Blackout at night followed by light at dawn will give your body clock the diurnal swing it needs to produce serotonin in the day and melatonin for sleeping, and DMT for dreaming and other hormones such as healthy cortisol in the morning and testosterone at night.

Eat the sun and let the night eat you.

[image of a body filled with light in a void of darkness illuminating some objects vaguely around them]

#### Heat and cold

If you have an ice bath an hour or so before bed you can help yourself go into a deeper sleep by supporting the body's natural swing towards cooler at night.

Ice baths and hot saunas provide the body with an acute stress that requires you only to remain still, you can push your body quite far this way and get a good swing as once you are in a sauna or ice bath it requires inaction to remain there, rather than sprinting or working out.

#### Exercise

For exercise you want the highest intensity possible to produce the highest peak of catabolic stress in order that your body will super compensate. Lifting weights is the best thing you can do for this, using compound movements such as squats, bench press and deadlifts that recruit the most muscles and move the most weight. If you're not lifting weights you can sprint with full intensity for a minute and then lay down and rest for 4 or 5 minutes. Then repeat 2 or 3 more times and you're done. You have only worked out for 3 or 4 minutes in total but if you have given it your all it will be enough.

This acute stressor will help you to sleep at night, and will also stimulate the release of natural hormones.

#### Recoverability

It is important to note that with many of these swings you will need to start slowly, each swing must be within your body's ability to recover from. Over time the body will build up a resistance and you can push it further. This is true for training volume, sun exposure, cold exposure and heat exposure. It also requires less will power to commit to smaller changes that can build over time. If you overreach on your recoverability you will get sick or injure yourself. To know if you are overreaching see "Heart Rate Variability" on page ...

### Emotional swings

Emotional bandwidth holds a gamut of emotions and feelings that can be felt deeply if we can only give ourselves the time, and the simultaneous detachment to safely experience them. If we have enough perspective we are able to find beauty in all emotions, ie melancholie and sadness. Healthy emotional swings give us a wide experience of life. Why do we find movies so enjoyable? It is because of the emotional swings they cause, with the detachment of being a viewer. Enjoy the movie of your life, and find the pleasure and beauty of sensation in all its peaks and valleys.

#### Anxiety Swings

When we talk about modern anxiety we almost always mean chronic anxiety. To escape this we actually can benefit from some acute anxiety. Both in the form of physical acute stressors but also by spending some time to consciously investigate what we are anxious about. In other words we actually need to swing further into anxiety or rather the subjects that are causing our anxiety in order to swing back the other direction into a calm and relaxed state. One way to do this can be journaling and list making. Often journaling helps us separate our circle of concern from our circle of influence, and hopefully will leave us realising what we can and can't change. We make an acute expression of our anxieties, and can let them go, just as exercise may help an agitated body to sleep at night. Other emotions we may regard as ugly can also be regarded as gifts to be transformed. Jealousy and anger can both be used as motivation, and pain is often dissipated or transformed once we bring the shining light of consciousness onto it.

#### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

A great biomarker for health is our HRV. The heart naturally has a variation in the rate at which it beats, if we are healthy it will speed up on our in breath and slow down on our out breath. As we do this we move between the sympathetic autonomic nervous system on the in breath and the parasympathetic ANS on the out breath. If we are unhealthy and in a state of constant anxiety we won't have the variability in our heart rate.

There is a natural resting breath rate of about 6 breaths per minute. We can regulate our breath to this speed and if we do so we will optimise the coherence between our breathing and our HRV. If we measure our HRV in the morning after waking up we get an idea of how well our HRV and our parasympathetic ANS is performing. And if we do this everyday we can recognise trends and adjust accordingly. If we are seeing a downward trend in HRV we might be over stressing ourselves and should try to increase sleep or take a rest day from working out. If we are seeing an upwards trend we could benefit from adding some more temporary stressors such as intensity to our workouts, we would then see a temporary decrease in HRV but we would be increasing our HRV long term, which is the more important value.

HRV will alert us to overreaching days or weeks before an increasing resting heart rate or other symptoms will let us know something is wrong.

Many of the physical inversion swings mentioned in this article will increase HRV, such as deep sleeping/working out, light dark swings, etc.

Hope gratitude and love will increase your HRV and Anxiety and anger will decrease it. If we are aware we are anxious or angry, reducing and controlling our breath rate will help us to move out of this mental state and raise our HRV again bringing coherence to our in and out breath, and balancing our yin yang forces.

| YIN | YANG |
|---|---|
| Parasympathetic ANS | Sympathetic ANS |
| Breathe out | Breath in |
| Recover rest digest | Fight or flight |
| sleep | wake |
| anabolic | catabolic |

There can be times when we want a low HRV, when we want to be in fight or flight, during an intense weight lift or to sprint 100m. In this case we may benefit from increasing our breath rate especially shortening the duration of our outbreath. We will move our body into a Sympathetic ANS state.

#### Meditation Swings

The great thing about meditation is that it increases our awareness and our feeling of being a witness. This consciousness can then carry over into the rest of our life, and help give us perspective on our emotions.

In meditation itself we move away from the business of the mind, perhaps from the emotional states we have been in chronically for a while. And interestingly it is in that state of emptiness that imagination can enter most strongly, we may become visionary and hallucinogenic. Which is perhaps the natural state of the mind that we allow petty chronic states to cloud. It is the swing to empty that gets the most full.

Removal of stimulus in many sensations will lead to a compensatory hallucination as our brain swings to its natural state of pattern interpretation. We can put ourselves in darkness or uniform brightness of a snow storm or by creating a mask that blocks all vision but creates a uniform field of light. And we can do it aurally by listening to white noise. Eating snow may also be a good way to imagine tastes. A sensory deprivation tank combines many of these sensation blankets and is great to use when you have the chance.

#### Reverse Meditation Swing

There is a reverse meditation you can do. Instead of trying to reach a state of pure awareness, which may lead to spontaneous inspirations and imaginative thoughts. we can instead try to imagine something, which may lead to spontaneous states of pure awareness. In other words the spaces when we do not receive our imaginative request can be filled with a non-thought as we wait for our imagination to take hold.

### Physical Emotional and conceptual realms

We have talked about the physical and now the emotional, but there is also a conceptual/spiritual realm in which to use inversion swings. All of the realms influence each other. There are several ways of categorising these realms such as locating the physical at our reptilian brain, the emotional at our mammalian brain and the conceptual at our neo cortex. Or we divide it as: willing feeling and thinking. Or belly, heart and head.

The heart gives us our emotional bandwidth, it is our capacity to recognise beauty. And to find pleasure in the world. It is our enjoyment.

The Head realm should have razor sharp clarity and deep imagination. It is a sharp knife of consciousness that may also swing into an unconscious reverie of imagination.

In Chi Gong these realms are stacked in a pyramid shape. And each lower realm must be wider than the next one so that the structure is stable. If we are too much in our head without a foundation of connection to our body we may topple over.

We want a physical vessel that can create its own chemistry for emotional and spiritual bandwidth. A healthy energized vessel gaining energy from the sun and physical connection to the earth.

### Conceptual Swings

Expanding the mind is an exercise in conceptual swings. We come across new concepts and pieces of information and we have to find a way to fit them into our existing network. Often we are presented with multiple truths that seem at odds with one another. Or our picture of the world will not fit with another person's viewpoint. These simultaneous contrasting truths and viewpoints are opportunities for growth. Simultaneous contrast is an outcome of any linking of concepts as everything is in a way both a contradiction of all other things and is also the same as all other things. The most linking of concepts we can have could be described as a hallucinogenic experience. Pattern recognition then is the backbone of the simultaneous contrast, Or the inversion swing.

Just as in the emotional realm we become healthy when we can witness various truths without becoming reactionary. We need to be able to come across an idea or another viewpoint and be able to find value in it. And more importantly to find beauty in it. Because just like in the emotional realm beauty is our yard stick.

If we can hold on to a contrasting concept we may eventually unify it into our network and become larger.
